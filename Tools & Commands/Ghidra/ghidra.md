# Ghidra: Professional Overview and Usage Guide

## Overview
Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) suite of tools developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States. It supports a variety of operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Ghidra is used for analyzing compiled code for a wide range of platforms and is primarily aimed at reverse engineering malware, performing vulnerability research, and understanding proprietary code.

To start Ghidra on a linux machine, you can use the following command to start the application"
```
ghidra
```
## Key Features
- **Support for Multiple Architectures**: x86, x86-64, ARM, PowerPC, MIPS, and more.
- **Disassembler and Decompiler**: Converts machine code to assembly or high-level pseudo-code.
- **Interactive GUI**: Includes features like drag-and-drop navigation, function graphs, and cross-referencing.
- **Scripting and Automation**: Java and Python support for automation.
- **Version Tracking**: Collaborative reverse engineering capabilities.
- **Extensibility**: Users can create and integrate plugins.
- **Decompiler**: Produces readable C-like code from binaries.

## Getting Started with Ghidra
1. **Create a Project**:
   - Start Ghidra and create a new project (non-shared or shared).
   - Import the binary or executable file for analysis.

2. **Auto Analysis**:
   - Upon importing, Ghidra will prompt for auto-analysis.
   - Recommended to use it for function detection and initial disassembly.

## Navigating the Ghidra Interface
- **CodeBrowser**:
  - Central analysis tool in Ghidra.
  - Displays disassembly, decompiled output, symbol tree, function list, and more.

- **Symbol Tree**:
  - View all identified functions, classes, namespaces, and data types.

- **Decompiler Window**:
  - View high-level decompiled pseudo-C code.
  - Synchronized with assembly view for cross-reference.

- **Listing Window**:
  - Displays disassembled machine code.
  - Allows manual labeling and commenting.

- **Function Graph**:
  - Graphical view of function call structure.

## Key Tools and Utilities in Ghidra
- **Data Type Manager**:
  - Define and manage custom structures, enums, and data types.

- **Function Signature Override**:
  - Adjust and redefine function prototypes for better decompilation accuracy.

- **Search Tools**:
  - String search, function search, data reference search, etc.

- **Scripting Console**:
  - Java or Jython console to automate tasks.
  - Access Ghidra API for custom scripting.

## Writing Scripts in Ghidra
- **Languages**: Java and Python (Jython-based).
- **Script Manager**: Browse and run example scripts.
- **Custom Scripts**:
  - Create in the `/ghidra_scripts/` directory.
  - Use Ghidra APIs to interact with program data.

### Example Python Script (Jython)
```python
from ghidra.program.model.symbol import RefType
from ghidra.util.task import ConsoleTaskMonitor

listing = currentProgram.getListing()
monitor = ConsoleTaskMonitor()

for function in currentProgram.getFunctionManager().getFunctions(True):
    print("Function name:", function.getName())
```

## Collaboration Features
- **Version Tracking**:
  - Track changes made to a project.
  - Merge and compare analysis results.

- **Shared Projects**:
  - Host on a shared server for multi-user collaboration.
