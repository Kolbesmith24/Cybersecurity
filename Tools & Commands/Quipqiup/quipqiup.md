# Quick Guide to Quipqiup

**Quipqiup** is an **online cipher solver** used to **automatically break simple substitution ciphers** like Caesar, Atbash, and monoalphabetic ciphers (e.g., cryptograms).

## How It Works

1. **Paste your ciphertext** into the input box (e.g., cryptogram or Caesar cipher).
2. Click **"Decrypt!"**
3. The tool attempts to automatically detect and decode the cipher.

## Example

### Input:
```
gsv xlwv gl gsrh rh z hvxivg
```

### Output:
```
the code to this is a secret
```

Detected cipher: **Atbash**

## What Can It Solve?

| Cipher Type         | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Monoalphabetic      | Single-letter substitution (cryptograms)         |
| Caesar              | Letters shifted by a fixed number                |
| Atbash              | Reversed alphabet (A â†” Z, B â†” Y...)              |
| Simple Substitution | Mixed-letter mappings (classic ciphers)          |

## Tips

- Works best on longer ciphertexts (more context = better accuracy).
- It's fully automatic â€” great for when youâ€™re stuck and need help spotting the pattern.
- Not effective for complex ciphers (like VigenÃ¨re or Enigma).
