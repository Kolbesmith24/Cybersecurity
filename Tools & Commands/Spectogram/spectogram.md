# Spectogram – Audio Spectrogram Visualization & Analysis Tool

**Spectogram** is a Python-based utility that generates visual representations of audio data using spectrograms. It’s particularly useful for inspecting hidden messages or patterns in audio files, commonly leveraged in steganography, forensics, and CTF challenges.

---
### Features
Spectogram provides the following capabilities:
- **Generate spectrograms** from audio files such as `.wav` and `.mp3`
- **Visual pattern recognition** to spot anomalies or hidden data
- **Supports color mapping and formatting** for enhanced visibility
- **Simple CLI interface** for fast integration in analysis workflows
- **Extremely useful in CTFs** for challenges involving audio steganography

---
### Usage
To generate a spectrogram from an audio file, run:
```bash
python spectogram.py <audiofile>
```
#### Optional Parameters
While some versions of Spectogram scripts may vary, here are common usage tips:

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|`<audiofile>`|Path to the audio file you want to analyze|
|`--save`|(Optional) Save the spectrogram image to disk|
|`--cmap`|(Optional) Change the color map used for visualization (e.g., `gray`, `viridis`)|
|`--dpi`|(Optional) Adjust the resolution of the output image|

---
### Example
To analyze an audio file called `message.wav` and save the spectrogram with a grayscale color map:
```bash
python spectogram.py message.wav --save --cmap gray --dpi 200
```

---
### Use Cases
- **CTF Challenges**: Reveal hidden flags encoded into the audio signal’s frequency spectrum
- **Forensics**: Visualize irregularities in audio patterns
- **Security Research**: Detect stego content or verify audio integrity
- **Digital Art**: Generate artistic frequency-based audio visuals

---
### Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed (depending on the version you use):
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy scipy
```

Some versions may also require `scikit-learn`, `wave`, or `pydub` for advanced input handling.

---
### Notes
- Spectogram is typically used in offline analysis—be sure to open the saved image with a zoomable image viewer to inspect fine details.
- Patterns might only become visible with adjusted color maps or contrast enhancements.
