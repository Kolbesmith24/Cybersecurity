# XSS Discovery
## Automated Discovery
Common open-source tools that can assist us in XSS discovery are [XSS Strike](https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike), [Brute XSS](https://github.com/rajeshmajumdar/BruteXSS), and [XSSer](https://github.com/epsylon/xsser). We can try `XSS Strike` by cloning it to our VM with `git clone`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike.git
cd XSStrike
pip install -r requirements.txt
python xsstrike.py
```
- May have to start environment first [[Add ip to etc hosts#Environment Setup]]

We can then run the script and provide it a URL with a parameter using `-u`. 

Let's try using it with a `Reflected XSS` example page from earlier:
```bash
python xsstrike.py -u "http://SERVER_IP:PORT/index.php?task=test" 
```
- The tool identified the parameter as vulnerable to XSS from the first payload.
## Manual Discovery
### XSS Payloads
The most basic method of looking for XSS vulnerabilities is manually testing various XSS payloads against an input field in a given web page. 

We can find huge lists of XSS payloads online, like the one on [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/XSS%20Injection/README.md) or the one in [PayloadBox](https://github.com/payloadbox/xss-payload-list). 
#### Testing Payload Examples
We can test whether the page is vulnerable to XSS with the following basic XSS payload:
```html
<script>alert(window.origin)</script>
```

```html
<plaintext>
```
- Will stop rendering the HTML code that comes after it and display it as plaintext

```html
<script>print()</script>
```
- Will pop up the browser print dialog, which is unlikely to be blocked by any browsers
### XSS Payloads Continued
We can then begin testing these payloads one by one by copying each one and adding it in our form, and seeing whether an alert box pops up.
> Note: XSS can be injected into any input in the HTML page, which is not exclusive to HTML input fields, but may also be in HTTP headers like the Cookie or User-Agent (i.e., when their values are displayed on the page).

Majority of the above payloads do not work because these payloads are written for a wide variety of injection points (like injecting after a single quote) or are designed to evade certain security measures (like sanitization filters).

This is why it is not very efficient to resort to manually copying/pasting XSS payloads

This is why it may be more efficient to write our own Python script to automate sending these payloads and then comparing the page source to see how our payloads were rendered. 
- This can help us in advanced cases where XSS tools cannot easily send and compare payloads. This way, we would have the advantage of customizing our tool to our target web application.
## Code Review
The most reliable method of detecting XSS vulnerabilities is manual code review. 

If we understand precisely how our input is being handled all the way until it reaches the web browser, we can write a custom payload that should work with high confidence.
