# Identifying Filters
## Filter/WAF Detection
We can see that if we try the previous operators we tested, like (`;`, `&&`, `||`), we get the error message `invalid input`.

This indicates that something we sent triggered a security mechanism in place that denied our request.

In this case, we see it in the field where the output is displayed, meaning that it was detected and prevented by the `PHP` web application itself. `If the error message displayed a different page, with information like our IP and our request, this may indicate that it was denied by a WAF`.

So, the web application either `detected a blacklisted character` or `detected a blacklisted command`, or both. So, let us see how to bypass each.
### Blacklisted Characters
A web application may have a list of blacklisted characters, and if the command contains them, it would deny the request. The `PHP` code may look something like the following:
```php
$blacklist = ['&', '|', ';', ...SNIP...];
foreach ($blacklist as $character) {
    if (strpos($_POST['ip'], $character) !== false) {
        echo "Invalid input";
    }
}
```
If any character in the string we sent matches a character in the blacklist, our request is denied.
### Identifying Blacklisted Character
Let us reduce our request to one character at a time and see when it gets blocked. If we still get the same error message by just adding 1 character (such as `;`), we know that character is blocked.
