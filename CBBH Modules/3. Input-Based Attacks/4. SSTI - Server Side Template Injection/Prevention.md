# Prevention
To prevent SSTI vulnerabilities, we must ensure that user input is never fed into the call to the template engine's rendering function in the template parameter. This can be achieved by carefully going through the different code paths and ensuring that user input is never added to a template before a call to the rendering function.

Suppose a web application intends to have users modify existing templates or upload new ones for business reasons. In that case, it is crucial to implement proper hardening measures to prevent the takeover of the web server. This process can include hardening the template engine by removing potentially dangerous functions that can be used to achieve remote code execution from the execution environment. Removing dangerous functions prevents attackers from using these functions in their payloads. However, this technique is prone to bypasses. A better approach would be to separate the execution environment in which the template engine runs entirely from the web server, for instance, by setting up a separate execution environment such as a Docker container.
