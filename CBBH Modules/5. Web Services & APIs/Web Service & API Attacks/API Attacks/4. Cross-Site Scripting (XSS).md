# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Refer to [[/Offensive Security Techniques/Web Exploitation Techniques/XSS - Cross-Site Scripting/]] for in-depth attacks.

An XSS vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the target's browser and result in complete web application compromise if chained together with other vulnerabilities.
## Example Scenario
Suppose we are having a better look at the API of the previous section, `http://<TARGET IP>:3000/api/download`.

Let us first interact with it through the browser by requesting the below.
![Message: 'test_value not found!'](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/160/6.png)
- `test_value` is reflected in the response.

Let us see what happens when we enter a payload such as the below (instead of _test_value_).
```javascript
<script>alert(document.domain)</script>
```
![Error message: Cannot GET /api/download/<script>alert(document.domain)</script>](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/160/9.png)

It looks like the application is encoding the submitted payload. We can try URL-encoding our payload once and submitting it again, as follows.
```javascript
%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.domain%29%3C%2Fscript%3E
```
![Alert box displaying IP address 10.129.144.21, triggered by script in URL.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/160/10.png)

Now our submitted JavaScript payload is evaluated successfully. The API endpoint is vulnerable to XSS!
