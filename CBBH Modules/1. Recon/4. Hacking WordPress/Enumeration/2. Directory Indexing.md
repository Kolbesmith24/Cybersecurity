# Directory Indexing
Even if a plugin is deactivated, it may still be accessible, and therefore we can gain access to its associated scripts and functions. Deactivating a vulnerable plugin does not improve the WordPress site's security. It is best practice to either remove or keep up-to-date any unused plugins.
## Scanning with wpscan
We can either manually enumerate for directories whose contents can be listed or, run `WPScan`:
```shell
wpscan --url http://IP:PORT
```
## Example Scenario
The following example shows a disabled plugin.
![WordPress plugins list showing 'Mail Masta' with options to activate or delete, and 'Photo Gallery' with option to deactivate.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/17/plugin-deactivated3.png)

If we browse to the plugins directory, we can see that we still have access to the `Mail Masta` plugin.
```
http://<target>/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/
```
![Directory listing of /wp-content/plugins/mail-masta showing folders and files including amazon_api, inc, lib, plugin-interface.php, and readme.txt.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/17/plugin-mailmasta2.png)

We can also view the directory listing using cURL and convert the HTML output to a nice readable format using `html2text`.
```bash
curl -s -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/ | html2text
```

This type of access is called `Directory Indexing`. It allows us to navigate the folder and access files that may contain sensitive information or vulnerable code. It is best practice to disable directory indexing on web servers so a potential attacker cannot gain direct access to any files or folders other than those necessary for the website to function properly.
