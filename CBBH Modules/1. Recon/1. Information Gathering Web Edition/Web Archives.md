# Web Archives
Thanks to the [Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/), we have a unique opportunity to revisit the past and explore the digital footprints of websites as they once were.
## What is the Wayback Machine?
A digital archive of the World Wide Web and other information on the Internet.

It allows users to "go back in time" and view snapshots of websites as they appeared at various points in their history.
