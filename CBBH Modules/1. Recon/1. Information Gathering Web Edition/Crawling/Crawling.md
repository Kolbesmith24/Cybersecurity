# Crawling
Often called `spidering`, is the `automated process of systematically browsing the World Wide Web`. Similar to how a spider navigates its web, a web crawler follows links from one page to another, collecting information. These crawlers are essentially bots that use pre-defined algorithms to discover and index web pages.

There are two primary types of crawling strategies.
## Breadth-First Crawling

`Breadth-first crawling` prioritizes exploring a website's width before going deep. It starts by crawling all the links on the seed page, then moves on to the links on those pages, and so on. This is useful for getting a broad overview of a website's structure and content.
## Depth-First Crawling

In contrast, `depth-first crawling` prioritizes depth over breadth. It follows a single path of links as far as possible before backtracking and exploring other paths. This can be useful for finding specific content or reaching deep into a website's structure.
## The Importance of Context
Understanding the context surrounding the extracted data is paramount.

The true value of extracted data lies in connecting the dots and constructing a comprehensive picture of the target's digital landscape.
