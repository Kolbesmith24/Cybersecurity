# Back End Servers
the hardware and operating system on the back end that hosts all of the applications necessary to run the web application. It is the real system running all of the processes and carrying out all of the tasks that make up the entire web application.
## Software
The back end server contains the other 3 back end components:

- `Web Server`
- `Database`
- `Development Framework`

- Other software components on the back end server may include [hypervisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor), containers, and WAFs.

There are many popular combinations of "stacks" for back-end servers, which contain a specific set of back end components. Some common examples include:

|Combinations|Components|
|---|---|
|[LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_\(software_bundle\))|`Linux`, `Apache`, `MySQL`, and `PHP`.|
|[WAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_\(software_bundle\)#WAMP)|`Windows`, `Apache`, `MySQL`, and `PHP`.|
|[WINS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack)|`Windows`, `IIS`, `.NET`, and `SQL Server`|
|[MAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAMP)|`macOS`, `Apache`, `MySQL`, and `PHP`.|
|[XAMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAMPP)|Cross-Platform, `Apache`, `MySQL`, and `PHP/PERL`.|

We can find a comprehensive list of Web Solution Stacks in this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack).
## Hardware
The back end server contains all of the necessary hardware. The power and performance capabilities of this hardware determine how stable and responsive the web application will be.
