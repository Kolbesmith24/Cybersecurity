# Authentication Bypass via Direct Access
## Direct Access
The most straightforward way of bypassing authentication checks is to request the protected resource directly from an unauthenticated context. 

An unauthenticated attacker can access protected information if the web application does not properly verify that the request is authenticated.

For instance, let us assume a web application uses the following snippet of PHP code to verify whether a user is authenticated to access `admin.php`:
```php
if(!$_SESSION['active']) {
	header("Location: index.php");
}
```
- This code redirects the user to `/index.php` if the session is not active/authenticated
- However, the PHP script does not stop execution, resulting in protected information within the page being sent in the response body.
- We can capture the request and change the GET header to `/admin.php`

If the entire admin page is contained in the response body after capturing and sending in Burp, but we can't access it in our web browser, we can trick the browser into displaying the admin page by intercepting the response and changing the status code from `302` to `200`. 

To do this, enable `Intercept` in Burp. Afterward, browse to the `/admin.php` endpoint in the web browser. Next, right-click on the request and select `Do intercept > Response to this request` to intercept the response:

Afterward, forward the request by clicking on `Forward`. Since we intercepted the response, we can now edit it. To force the browser to display the content, we need to change the status code from `302 Found` to `200 OK`.

Afterward, we can forward the response. If we switch back to our browser window, we can see that the protected information is rendered:

Afterward, we can forward the response. If we switch back to our browser window, we can see that the protected information is rendered.

To prevent the protected information from being returned in the body of the redirect response, the PHP script needs to exit after issuing the redirect:
```php
if(!$_SESSION['active']) {
	header("Location: index.php");
	exit;
}
```
# Authentication Bypass via Parameter Modification
An authentication implementation can be flawed if it depends on the presence or value of an HTTP parameter, introducing authentication vulnerabilities.
## Parameter Modification
Let us take a look at our target web application. This time, we are provided with credentials for the user `htb-stdnt`. 

After logging in, we are redirected to `/admin.php?user_id=183`.

In our web browser, we can see that we seem to be lacking privileges, as we cannot access the `/admin.php` page.

To investigate the purpose of the `user_id` parameter, we can remove it from our request to `/admin.php`.
- When doing so, we are redirected back to the login screen at `/index.php`, even though our session provided in the `PHPSESSID` cookie is still valid.
- Thus, we can assume that the parameter `user_id` is related to authentication.

We can bypass authentication entirely by accessing the URL `/admin.php?user_id=183` directly without the `PHPSESSID`:

If we can guess or brute-force the user ID of an administrator, we might be able to access the page with administrative privileges, thus revealing the admin information.
- We can use the techniques discussed in the [[1. Brute-Force Attacks]] sections to obtain an administrator ID. Afterward, we can obtain administrative privileges by specifying the admin's user ID in the `user_id` parameter.

We can create a list of ids with `seq 0 1000 > ids.txt`, then use ffuf to test for different ids:
```bash
ffuf -w ./ids.txt -u http://94.237.123.208:57180/admin.php?user_id=FUZZ -fr "Could not load admin data."
```
