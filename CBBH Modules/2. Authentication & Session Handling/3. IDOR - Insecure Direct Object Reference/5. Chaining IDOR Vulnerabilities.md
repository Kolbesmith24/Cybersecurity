# Chaining IDOR Vulnerabilities
## Example Scenario
Usually, a `GET` request to the API endpoint should return the details of the requested user, so we may try calling it to see if we can retrieve our user's details.

We also notice that after sending the PUT request to update our account information, after the page loads, it fetches the user details with a `GET` request to the same API endpoint.

### Information Disclosure
If we change the ID of this `GET` request, we can get all the information from another user with a different ID.
### Modifying Other Users' Details
Now, with the user's `uuid` at hand, we can change this user's details by sending a `PUT` request to `/profile/api.php/profile/2` with the above details along with any modifications we made, as follows:
![HTTP PUT request to /profile/api.php with JSON data including 'uid', 'uuid', 'role', 'full name', 'email', and 'about' fields. Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/134/web_attacks_idor_modify_another_user.jpg)

We don't get any access control error messages this time, and when we try to `GET` the user details again, we see that we did indeed update their details:

![HTTP GET request to /profile/api.php with headers including Host, User-Agent, and Cookie role=employee. Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK with JSON data including 'uid', 'uuid', 'role', 'full name', 'email', and 'about'](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/134/web_attacks_idor_new_another_user_details.jpg)
### Extra Attacks
In addition to allowing us to view potentially sensitive details, the ability to modify another user's details also enables us to perform several other attacks. One type of attack is `modifying a user's email address` and then requesting a password reset link, which will be sent to the email address we specified, thus allowing us to take control over their account. 

Another potential attack is `placing an XSS payload in the 'about' field`, which would get executed once the user visits their `Edit profile` page, enabling us to attack the user in different ways.

Another potential attack is going to reset your own password, and before clicking send, capturing the `reset password` request and changing the `uid` to another user. This may allow you to change another users password from your account, then sign in as this other user.
## Chaining Two IDOR Vulnerabilities
Since we have identified an IDOR Information Disclosure vulnerability, we may also enumerate all users and look for other `roles`, ideally an admin role. 
- We can write a script to enumerate all users.

Once we go through all users, we find an admin with the admin role, and can update their information with the `role` cookie and the `uuid` of the admin
