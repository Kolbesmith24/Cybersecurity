# Caddyshack - DawgCTF 2025
The challenge instructs us to locate and connect to a server hosted at `caddyshack.umbccd.net`.
## Initial Reconnaissance
Attempting to access the website via a web browser resulted in a connection error â€” the server appeared unreachable over HTTP/HTTPS.

To identify open ports and services, I performed an `nmap` scan:
```
nmap -v -sV -sC -T4 caddyshack.umbccd.net
```

The scan revealed an open port:
- **Port 70**: Running the **Gopher** protocol

Additionally, the scan output included a reference to a file named `Flag.txt`.

## Exploring the Gopher Service
Knowing that Gopher is a protocol designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents over the Internet, I accessed the server using the Gopher protocol by navigating to:
```
gopher://caddyshack.umbccd.net:70
```

This presented a Gopher-style directory listing. Among the entries, there was a file named `File.txt`.

Appending the file to the Gopher path:

```
gopher://caddyshack.umbccd.net:70/File.txt
```

Navigating to this link revealed the challenge **flag**.
