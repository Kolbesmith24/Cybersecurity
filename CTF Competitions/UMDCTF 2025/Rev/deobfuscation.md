# Deobfuscation - UMDCTF2025 Challenge Write-up
## Overview
We were provided with a file named `flag`, which was an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) executable. Our objective was to analyze this binary, identify any hidden or encrypted data, and recover the correct password.

---

## Reconnaissance Phase

### 1. Initial Inspection of the File
Upon receiving the `flag` file, our first step was to perform a quick inspection.

Running basic file commands confirmed it was a compiled ELF binary:

```bash
file flag
```

To quickly check for any readable text inside the binary, we tried using `cat`:

However, the output was mostly unreadable binary data, indicating that any useful information would not be available through a simple inspection.

---

### 2. Loading into GDB for Analysis

Since basic viewing didn't yield helpful information, we loaded the binary into **GDB** (GNU Debugger) for a more detailed analysis:

```bash
gdb ./flag
```

Once inside GDB, we disassembled the binary and examined different memory regions to find anything unusual. We looked for:
- Suspicious or structured patterns in memory.
- Embedded strings.
- Memory sections with static data.
    

Using the `x` (examine memory) command, we identified two important memory locations:
- One containing seemingly **encrypted data**.
- One containing potential **key data**.
    

---

## Exploitation Phase
### 1. Identifying the Important Sections
Through memory inspection, we identified two key regions:

- **Encrypted Data** at address `0x402000`:
    - A sequence of unreadable bytes.

- **Key Data** at address `0x402034`:
    
    - Another sequence of bytes that seemed random but was of similar length, suggesting it could serve as the decryption key.

This pattern suggested that the encrypted data could be decrypted using the key data, likely through an XOR operation.

> **XOR Encryption**: XOR (exclusive OR) is a basic but effective symmetric encryption technique. XORing the same value twice with the same key returns the original value (`(A XOR B) XOR B = A`).

---

### 2. Devising a Decryption Strategy
Given the presence of encrypted data and a key, and recognizing the common use of XOR in simple CTF challenges, we formulated the following decryption plan:
- Read the encrypted data.
- Read the key data
- XOR each byte of the encrypted data with the corresponding byte of the key data.
- Assemble the resulting bytes into the plaintext password.
    

Since the two regions were aligned and of similar lengths, this further confirmed that a **byte-wise XOR** was the correct approach.

---

### 3. Automating Decryption with a Python Script
To automate the decryption process, we wrote a simple Python script.

The script:
- Defined the encrypted data bytes.
- Defined the key bytes.
- XORed each pair of corresponding bytes.
- Collected and printed the decrypted output as readable text.

Hereâ€™s the script used:

### 4. Recovering the Password
Running the decryption script revealed the hidden password:

```
UMDCTF{r3v3R$E-i$_Th3_#B3ST#_4nT!-M@lW@r3_t3chN!Qu3}
```

Thus, we successfully solved the challenge.
