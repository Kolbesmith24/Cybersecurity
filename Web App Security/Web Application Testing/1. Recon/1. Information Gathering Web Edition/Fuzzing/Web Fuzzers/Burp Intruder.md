# Burp Intruder
can be used to fuzz pages, directories, sub-domains, parameters, parameters values, and many other things. 

Though it is much more advanced than most CLI-based web fuzzing tools, the free `Burp Community` version is throttled at a speed of 1 request per second, making it extremely slow compared to CLI-based web fuzzing tools, which can usually read up to 10k requests per second. This is why we would only use the free version of Burp Intruder for short queries.

The `Pro` version has unlimited speed, which makes it one of the best web fuzzing and brute-forcing tools.
