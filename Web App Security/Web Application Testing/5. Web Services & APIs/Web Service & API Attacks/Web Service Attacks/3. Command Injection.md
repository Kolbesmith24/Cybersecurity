# Command Injection
If a web service uses user-controlled input to execute a system command on the back-end server, an attacker may be able to inject a malicious payload to subvert the intended command and execute his own.

You may have come across connectivity-checking web services in router admin panels or even websites that merely execute a ping command towards a website of your choosing.
## Command Injection Web Service Attack Example
Suppose we are assessing such a connectivity-checking service residing in `http://<TARGET IP>:3003/ping-server.php/ping`. Suppose we have also been provided with the source code of the service.
```php
<?php
function ping($host_url_ip, $packets) {
        if (!in_array($packets, array(1, 2, 3, 4))) {
                die('Only 1-4 packets!');
        }
        $cmd = "ping -c" . $packets . " " . escapeshellarg($host_url_ip);
        $delimiter = "\n" . str_repeat('-', 50) . "\n";
        echo $delimiter . implode($delimiter, array("Command:", $cmd, "Returned:", shell_exec($cmd)));
}

if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'GET') {
        $prt = explode('/', $_SERVER['PATH_INFO']);
        call_user_func_array($prt[1], array_slice($prt, 2));
}
?>
```
- A function called _ping_ is defined, which takes two arguments _host_url_ip_ and _packets_. 
- A variable called _cmd_ is then created, which forms the ping command to be executed. 
- Two values are "parsed", _packets_ and _host_url_. [escapeshellarg()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.escapeshellarg.php) is used to escape the _host_url_'s value. 

According to PHP's function reference, `escapeshellarg()` adds single quotes around a string and quotes/escapes any existing single quotes allowing you to pass a string directly to a shell function and having it be treated as a single safe argument. 
- This function should be used to escape individual arguments to shell functions coming from user input. The shell functions include exec(), system() shell_exec() and the backtick operator. If the _host_url_'s value was not escaped, the below could happen.

- The command specified by the _cmd_ parameter is executed with the help of the _shell_exec()_ PHP function.

If the request method is GET, an existing function can be called with the help of [call_user_func_array()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func-array.php). 
- The _call_user_func_array()_ function is a special way to call an existing PHP function. 
- It takes a function to call as its first parameter, then takes an array of parameters as its second parameter. 
- This means that instead of `http://<TARGET IP>:3003/ping-server.php/ping/www.example.com/3` an attacker could issue a request as follows. `http://<TARGET IP>:3003/ping-server.php/system/ls`. This constitutes a command injection vulnerability!

You can test this with `curl`:
```shell
curl http://<TARGET IP>:3003/ping-server.php/system/ls
```
