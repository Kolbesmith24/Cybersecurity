# IDOR in Insecure APIs
IDOR vulnerabilities may also exist in function calls and APIs, and exploiting them would allow us to perform various actions as other users.

`IDOR Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities` allow us to read various types of resources, `IDOR Insecure Function Calls` enable us to call APIs or execute functions as another user. Such functions and APIs can be used to change another user's private information, reset another user's password, or even buy items using another user's payment information.
## Identifying Insecure APIs: Example Scenario
Going back to our `Employee Manager` web application, we can start testing the `Edit Profile` page for IDOR vulnerabilities:
![Employee Manager with 'Edit Profile' button, links to 'Personal Records', 'Documents', and 'Contracts'](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/134/web_attacks_idor_employee_manager.jpg)

When we click on the `Edit Profile` button, we are taken to a page to edit information of our user profile, namely `Full Name`, `Email`, and `About Me`, which is a common feature in many web applications:

![Edit Profile form with fields for Full Name 'Amy Lindon', Email 'a_lindon@employees.htbl', About Me 'A Release is like a boat. 80% of the holes plugged is not good enough.', and 'Update profile' button](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/134/web_attacks_idor_edit_profile.jpg)

We can change any of the details in our profile and click `Update profile`, and we'll see that they get updated and persist through refreshes, which means they get updated in a database somewhere. 

If we intercept the request through Burp, We see that the page is sending a `PUT` request to the `/profile/api.php/profile/1` API endpoint. 
- `PUT` requests are usually used in APIs to update item details, while `POST` is used to create new items, `DELETE` to delete items, and `GET` to retrieve item details. So, a `PUT` request for the `Update profile` function is expected. 

The interesting bit is the JSON parameters it is sending. We see that the `PUT` request includes a few hidden parameters, like `uid`, `uuid`, and most interestingly `role`, which is set to `employee`. The web application also appears to be setting the user access privileges (e.g. `role`) on the client-side, in the form of our `Cookie: role=employee` cookie, which appears to reflect the `role` specified for our user. This is a common security issue.
![HTTP PUT request to /profile/api.php with JSON data including 'uid', 'uuid', 'role', 'full name', 'email', and 'about' fields](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/134/web_attacks_idor_update_request.jpg)

So, unless the web application has a solid access control system on the back-end, `we should be able to set an arbitrary role for our user, which may grant us more privileges`. However, how would we know what other roles exist?
## Exploiting Insecure APIs
We know that we can change the `full_name`, `email`, and `about` parameters, as these are the ones under our control in the HTML form in the `/profile` web page. So, let's try to manipulate the other parameters.

Let's start by changing our `uid` to another user's `uid` (e.g. `"uid": 2`). However, any number we set other than our own `uid` gets us a response of `uid mismatch`.
- The web application appears to be comparing the request's `uid` to the API endpoint (`/1`). This means that a form of access control on the back-end prevents us from arbitrarily changing some JSON parameters.

We can then try to change the API endpoint to `/profile/api.php/profile/2`, and change `"uid": 2` to avoid the previous `uid mismatch`, and now we get a different error `uuid mismatch`.
- The web application appears to be checking if the `uuid` value we are sending matches the user's `uuid`.

Next, let's see if we can create a new user with a `POST` request to the API endpoint. We can change the request method to `POST`, change the `uid` to a new `uid`, and send the request to the API endpoint of the new `uid`:
![HTTP POST request to /profile/api.php with JSON data including 'uid', 'uuid', 'role', 'full name', 'email', and 'about' fields. Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK, message 'Creating new employees is for admins only'](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/134/web_attacks_idor_create_new_user_1.jpg)

We get an error message saying `Creating new employees is for admins only`. The same thing happens when we send a `Delete` request, as we get `Deleting employees is for admins only`. The web application might be checking our authorization through the `role=employee` cookie because this appears to be the only form of authorization in the HTTP request.

Finally, let's try to change our `role` to `admin`/`administrator` to gain higher privileges. Unfortunately, without knowing a valid `role` name, we get `Invalid role` in the HTTP response, and our `role` does not update: ![HTTP PUT request to /profile/api.php with JSON data including 'uid', 'uuid', 'role', 'full name', 'email', and 'about' fields. Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK, message 'Invalid role'](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/134/web_attacks_idor_invalid_role.jpg)
`Try to test the API against IDOR Information Disclosure vulnerabilities by attempting to get other users' details with GET requests`. If the API is vulnerable, we may be able to leak other users' details and then use this information to complete our IDOR attacks on the function calls.
