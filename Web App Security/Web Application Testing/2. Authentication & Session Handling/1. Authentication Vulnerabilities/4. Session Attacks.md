# Attacking Session Tokens
## Brute-Force Attack
Suppose a session token does not provide sufficient randomness and is cryptographically weak. In that case, we can brute-force valid session tokens similarly to how we were able to brute-force valid password-reset tokens.

For instance, consider the following web application that assigns a four-character session token:

As we have seen in previous sections, a four-character string can easily be brute-forced. Thus, we can use the techniques and commands discussed in the [[Cybersecurity/Web App Security/Web Application Testing/2. Authentication & Session Handling/1. Authentication Vulnerabilities/1. Brute-Force Attacks]] sections to brute-force all possible session tokens and hijack all active sessions.

When dealing with Session Tokens, make sure to send the login request multiple times and take note of the session tokens assigned by the web application and try to recognize any patterns.
- If the session tokens are very similar, we can brute-force any patterns that we find
## Attacking Predictable Session Tokens
In a more realistic scenario, the session token does provide sufficient randomness on the surface. However, the generation of session tokens is not truly random; it can be predicted by an attacker with insight into the session token generation logic.

The simplest form of predictable session tokens contains encoded data we can tamper with. For instance, consider the following session token:

While this session token might seem random at first, a simple analysis reveals that it is base64-encoded data:

Attacking Session Tokens
```bash
echo -n dXNlcj1odGItc3RkbnQ7cm9sZT11c2Vy | base64 -d

user=htb-stdnt;role=user
```

As we can see, the cookie contains information about the user and the role tied to the session. However, there is no security measure in place that prevents us from tampering with the data. We can forge our own session token by manipulating the data and base64-encoding it to match the expected format. This enables us to forge an admin cookie:
```bash
echo -n 'user=htb-stdnt;role=admin' | base64

dXNlcj1odGItc3RkbnQ7cm9sZT1hZG1pbg==
```

We can send this cookie to the web application to obtain administrative access:

The same exploit works for cookies containing differently encoded data. We should also keep an eye out for data in hex-encoding or URL-encoding. For instance, a session token containing hex-encoded data might look like this:

Just like before, we can forge an admin cookie:
```bash
echo -n 'user=htb-stdnt;role=admin' | xxd -p

```
## Session Fixation
An attack that enables an attacker to obtain a victim's valid session.

A web application vulnerable to session fixation does not assign a new session token after a successful authentication. If an attacker can coerce the victim into using a session token chosen by the attacker, session fixation enables an attacker to steal the victim's session and access their account.

For instance, assume a web application vulnerable to session fixation uses a session token in the HTTP cookie `session`. Furthermore, the web application sets the user's session cookie to a value provided in the `sid` GET parameter. Under these circumstances, a session fixation attack could look like this:
1. An attacker obtains a valid session token by authenticating to the web application. For instance, let us assume the session token is `a1b2c3d4e5f6`. Afterward, the attacker invalidates their session by logging out.
2. The attacker tricks the victim to use the known session token by sending the following link: `http://vulnerable.htb/?sid=a1b2c3d4e5f6`. When the victim clicks this link, the web application sets the `session` cookie to the provided value, i.e., the response looks like this:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[...]
Set-Cookie: session=a1b2c3d4e5f6
[...]
```
3. The victim authenticates to the vulnerable web application. The victim's browser already stores the attacker-provided session cookie, so it is sent along with the login request. The victim uses the attacker-provided session token since the web application does not assign a new one.
4. Since the attacker knows the victim's session token `a1b2c3d4e5f6`, they can hijack the victim's session.

A web application must assign a new randomly generated session token after successful authentication to prevent session fixation attacks.
### Improper Session Timeout
Lastly, a web application must define a proper [Session Timeout](https://owasp.org/www-community/Session_Timeout) for a session token. After the time interval defined in the session timeout has passed, the session will expire, and the session token is no longer accepted. If a web application does not define a session timeout, the session token would be valid infinitely, enabling an attacker to use a hijacked session effectively forever.
