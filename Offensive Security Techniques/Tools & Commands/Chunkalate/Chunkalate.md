# Chunkalate â€“ PNG Repair and Analysis Tool

**Chunkalate** is a Python-based utility designed to inspect, diagnose, and repair corruption issues in PNG files. It is currently a work-in-progress and may have limited functionality or stability in certain cases, but it offers a unique set of features aimed at automating the process of analyzing and fixing malformed PNG files.

---
## Features
Chunkalate's current and intended capabilities include:
- **Full PNG metadata inspection**: Extracts all available information from PNG files.
- **Repair functions**:
    - Fixes corrupted or missing **magic headers** and **footers**
    - Corrects **chunk lengths**, **chunk names**, and **chunk CRCs**
    - Adjusts incorrect **image dimensions**
    - Repairs issues related to **line feed conversions**
    - Smart CRC fixing based on detected errors

- **Chunk management**:
    - Identifies and corrects misplaced critical chunks (currently supports IHDR)
    - Replaces **critical missing chunks** with safe defaults
    - Attempts **brute-force recovery** of corrupted data chunks
    
- **Versioned saving**: Each modification is saved to a new file for traceability
- **Readable summary**: Provides a detailed report of all actions taken
- **User-friendly interactions**: Interactive pauses and clean screen output
