# Make Your Own Requests to Server
When finding something in a web request that fetches information from a link, you can change this to the admin page to get access to the admin page:
```
stockApi=http%3A%2F%2Fstock.weliketoshop.net%3A8080%2Fproduct%2Fstock%2Fcheck%3FproductId%3D1%26storeId%3D1
```
Turn this to:
```
stockApi=http%3a//localhost/admin
```
If you cant do actions because it requires admin access, click the action you are trying to do, capture the URL it is requesting, then submit the same HTTP request again, but change the URL variable to the same URL that is shown when clicking the action
## Lab 1:
1. Browse to `/admin` and observe that you can't directly access the admin page.
2. Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
3. Change the URL in the `stockApi` parameter to `http://localhost/admin`. This should display the administration interface.
4. Read the HTML to identify the URL to delete the target user, which is:
    `http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos`
5. Submit this URL in the `stockApi` parameter, to deliver the SSRF attack.
## Lab 2:
1. Visit a product, click **Check stock**, intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Intruder.
2. Change the `stockApi` parameter to `http://192.168.0.1:8080/admin` then highlight the final octet of the IP address (the number `1`) and click **Add ยง**.
3. In the **Payloads** side panel, change the payload type to **Numbers**, and enter 1, 255, and 1 in the **From** and **To** and **Step** boxes respectively.
4. Click **Start attack**.
5. Click on the **Status** column to sort it by status code ascending. You should see a single entry with a status of `200`, showing an admin interface.
6. Click on this request, send it to Burp Repeater, and change the path in the `stockApi` to: `/admin/delete?username=carlos`
