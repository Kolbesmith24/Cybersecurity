# What is Authentication?
The process of verifying the identity of a user or client.

3 Main Types:
1. Something you **know**
2. Something you **have**
3. Something you **are** or do
## Authentication vs Authorization
**Authentication:** The process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be. 
**Authorization:** verifying whether a user is allowed to do something.
### Authentication Vulnerabilities Arising
Most vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms occur in one of two ways:
1. The authentication mechanisms are weak because they fail to adequately protect against brute-force attacks.
2. Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the authentication mechanisms to be bypassed entirely by an attacker. 
	- Sometimes called "broken authentication"

Logic flaws cause the website to behave unexpectedly, which may or may not be a security issue. However, as authentication is so critical to security, it's very likely that flawed authentication logic exposes the website to security issues.
### Impact of Vulnerable Authentication
Can be severe. If an attacker bypasses authentication or brute-forces their way into another user's account, they have access to all the data and functionality that the compromised account has.
## Vulnerabilities in password-based login
For websites that adopt a password-based login process, the fact that they know the secret password is taken as sufficient proof of the user's identity. This means that the security of the website is compromised if an attacker is able to either obtain or guess the login credentials of another user.
### Brute-force attacks
When an attacker uses a system of trial and error to guess valid user credentials.
#### Brute-forcing usernames
Usernames are especially easy to guess if they conform to a recognizable pattern. Example:
- `firstname.lastname@somecompany.com`

Sometimes even high-privileged accounts are created using predictable usernames, such as `admin` or `administrator`.

During auditing, check whether the website discloses potential usernames publicly. For example, are you able to access user profiles without logging in? Even if the actual content of the profiles is hidden, the name used in the profile is sometimes the same as the login username. 

You should also check HTTP responses to see if any email addresses are disclosed. Occasionally, responses contain email addresses of high-privileged users, such as administrators or IT support.
#### Username enumeration
When an attacker is able to observe changes in the website's behavior in order to identify whether a given username is valid.

Typically occurs either on the login page, for example, when you enter a valid username but an incorrect password, or on registration forms when you enter a username that is already taken. This greatly reduces the time and effort required to brute-force a login because the attacker is able to quickly generate a shortlist of valid usernames.

While attempting to brute-force a login page, you should pay particular attention to any differences in:
- Status codes
- Error messages
- Response times
