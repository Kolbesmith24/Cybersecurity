# Study Guide
To study for the OSCP, I am first enumerating through all the boxes provided by HackTheBox that are in TJNull's OSCP list:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/htmlview

I am also utilizing PEN-200 course materials to go over all techniques and methodologies I've learned from my experiences.

Once I've completed all boxes and learned all techniques from each box, I am planning on taking practice exams to dial in my knowledge and focus on my weak areas.

Follow my progression as I post writups for each box I complete [here](/Writeups/Hack%20The%20Box/Machines).
