# Risk Management

## Strategic Risk
- Jeopardizes the ability to meet goals and objectives.

## Operational Risk
- Affects the ability to carry out activities.

## Compliance Risk
- Potential violations of laws or regulations.

# Product Lifecycle

## End of Sale
- Product won't be for sale but will continue support.

## End of Support
- Support is eliminated for the product.

## End of Life
- Vendor will not provide anything for the product.

# Security Principles and Configuration

## Default Configurations
- Insecure or misconfigured firewalls, open permissions, guest accounts, default passwords, etc.

## Weak Cipher Suites or Cryptographic Protocol Implementations
- Outdated, flawed, or insecure methods of encrypting data.

## Poor Key Management
- Insecure handling, storage, distribution, or lifecycle management of cryptographic keys.

## Poor Certificate Management
- Improper management can lead to expired, misused, or compromised certificates, causing security failures.

## Patch Management
- Patching operating systems, applications, and firmware.

## Principle of Least Privilege
- Granting users, systems, or applications the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks.

# IT Security Concepts

## IT Architecture
- Processes and practices used to design systems.

## Architectural Vulnerabilities
- Flaws or weaknesses in the overall design or structure of a system.

## System Sprawl
- New devices are added to networks, but old devices are not promptly disconnected, leading to security vulnerabilities.

# Malware Types

## Malware
- Malicious programs consisting of:
    - **Propagation Mechanism**: How it spreads.
    - **Payload**: The malicious action it performs.

## Viruses
- Spread from system to system with user interaction.
    - **Prevention**: Educating users on proper security.

## Worms
- Spread system to system by themselves.
    - **Prevention**: Keeping systems up to date.

## Trojans
- Appear as legitimate software but carry hidden malicious payloads.
    - **Prevention**: Application control.

## RATs (Remote Access Trojans)
- Provide backdoors for hackers.

## Spyware
- Gathers information without user knowledge.
    - **Examples**: Keystroke loggers, web browsing monitoring.

## Bloatware
- Unnecessary or unwanted software pre-installed on devices.

## Ransomware
- Blocks access to resources or files until ransom is paid.

## Crypto Malware
- Uses computer resources to mine cryptocurrency.

---

# Malware Prevention

## Preventing Malware
- Use anti-malware tools.
- Educate users.
- Update systems regularly.

## Backdoors
- Programmers create mechanisms for unauthorized access to systems.

## Logic Bombs
- Malware that triggers a payload when certain conditions are met.

## Rootkits
- Malware that escalates user privileges.

---

# Attack Vectors and Social Engineering

## User Mode vs. Kernel Mode
- **User Mode**: Regular user permissions.
- **Kernel Mode**: Root-level system permissions.

## Fileless Viruses
- Avoid detection by operating solely through computer memory.

## Botnets
- Networks of infected machines awaiting instructions.
    - **Common Uses**: Spam, DDoS attacks, crypto mining.

## Botnet Command and Control
- Hackers communicate with botnets through:
    - Internet Relay Chat (IRC).
    - P2P (peer-to-peer) networks.

## Script Types
- **Shell Scripts**: Executed in the command line.
- **Application Scripts**: Executed within application software.
- **Programming Language Scripts**: Executed through programming languages.

## VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)
- Macro scripting language.

# Cyber Attackers and Insider Threats

## Hacktivists
- Use hacking tools for political or social agendas.

## Nation-State Hacking Actors
- Advanced attackers typically trained by governments.

## Preventing Insider Threats
- Perform background checks.
- Apply least privilege controls.

## Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
- Highly skilled threats, often government-sponsored, using zero-day vulnerabilities.

## Defending Against APTs
- Implement strong systems and encryption.

# Phishing and Social Engineering Attacks

## Spear Phishing
- Targeted phishing attacks with specified payloads.

## Whaling
- Phishing attacks aimed at executives to steal information or gain access.

## Pharming
