# Cybersecurity Topics

## Credential Stuffing
- Exploits reused passwords to login to other sites.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site scripting occurs when an attacker embeds malicious scripts in a third-party website.

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF)
- Cross-site request forgery uses embedded malicious code on one site to trick the browser into sending malicious requests to another site (where the user is already logged in) without the user's knowledge and with their account.

## Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Targets servers into retrieving malicious data from what it believes to be a trusted source.

## Buffers
- Areas of memory set aside to store user-supplied content.

## Buffer Overflow Attacks
- Exploits occur when input larger than the buffer is provided, causing memory corruption or code execution.

## Cookies
- Track user activity across the web, often used for web server logins to reference earlier, successful logins.

### Cookie Guessing (AuthCookie Attack)
1. Login to a site with user1 and take note of the authcookie.
2. Logout and login as user2, then take note of the authcookie.
3. Compare the authcookies for user1 and user2, and find patterns between them.
4. Use the pattern to generate an authcookie for other users, such as admin, then intercept the login request to authenticate as admin.

### Session Replay Attack
- Attacker eavesdrops on a user session and steals their cookie to log in as them.

### Secure Cookies
- Cookies should always be sent over encrypted connections to prevent eavesdropping.

## Code Execution Attack
- Exploits vulnerabilities to run commands on the system.

### Remote Code Execution (RCE) / Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)
- RCE allows attackers to run commands over a network connection.
- ACE allows attackers to run commands locally on the system.

### Preventing Code Execution Attacks
- Limit application and administrative privileges.
- Patch systems and applications to remove vulnerabilities.

### Mitigating Privilege Escalation
- Perform input validation, patch systems, and enforce the least privilege principle.

## OWASP Top Ten
- A list of common web security vulnerabilities.
  
### Broken Access Control
- Developers fail to check on the backend whether a user is authorized to access specific functions.

### Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
- Occurs when a developer exposes application details without proper security checks, such as changing the ID number in a URL to access unauthorized resources.

### Cryptographic Failures
- Sensitive information is accidentally exposed due to poor cryptographic implementation, such as failing to implement HTTPS properly.

### Insecure Design
- Security issues arise when organizations fail to implement proper security practices.

### Security Misconfigurations

## Race Conditions
- A vulnerability that occurs when the proper function of a security control depends on the timing of an action.

### Time of Check/Time of Use Vulnerability
- A vulnerability where software checks if activity is authorized, but a delay before the action allows multiple users to exploit the resource (e.g., two users withdrawing money from an account with insufficient funds).

## Smurf Attack
- An attacker sends ICMP echo requests to broadcast addresses of third-party servers with a forged source address, causing the servers to send replies to the victim.

## Amplified Attack
- An attacker sends small requests that receive large responses, amplifying the attack's impact.

## Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Target
- DoS attacks target bandwidth, application, and operational technologies (OTs).

## Eavesdropping Attack

### Man-in-the-Browser Attack
- A type of MiTM attack where the attack occurs through a web browser, such as via a malicious browser extension.

### Replay Attack
- An attacker uses previously authenticated data (e.g., authentication token) to communicate with the server, pretending to be the victim. This can be prevented with session tokens and timestamps.

## SSL Stripping
- Tricking browsers into using unencrypted communications.

## Domain Name System (DNS)
- The system that translates IP addresses into hostnames or server names.

### DNS Poisoning

### Bluesnarfing
- Attackers force pairing to steal information from a device.

### Improving Bluetooth Security
- Recommendations include disabling Bluetooth when not in use and applying updates consistently.
